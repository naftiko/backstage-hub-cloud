    Creates an Amazon QuickSight user whose identity is associated with the
    Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity or role specified in the
    request. When you register a new user from the Amazon QuickSight API, Amazon
    QuickSight generates a registration URL. The user accesses this registration
    URL to create their account. Amazon QuickSight doesn't send a registration
    email to users who are registered from the Amazon QuickSight API. If you
    want new users to receive a registration email, then add those users in the
    Amazon QuickSight console. For more information on registering a new user in
    the Amazon QuickSight console, see  Inviting users to access Amazon
    QuickSight.
