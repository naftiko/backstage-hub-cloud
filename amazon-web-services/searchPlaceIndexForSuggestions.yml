    Generates suggestions for addresses and points of interest based on partial
    or misspelled free-form text. This operation is also known as autocomplete,
    autosuggest, or fuzzy matching. Optional parameters let you narrow your
    search results by bounding box or country, or bias your search toward a
    specific position on the globe.  You can search for suggested place names
    near a specified position by using BiasPosition, or filter results within a
    bounding box by using FilterBBox. These parameters are mutually exclusive;
    using both BiasPosition and FilterBBox in the same command returns an
    error.
