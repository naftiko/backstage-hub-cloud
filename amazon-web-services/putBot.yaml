  description: >-
    Creates an Amazon Lex conversational bot or replaces an existing bot. When
    you create or update a bot you are only required to specify a name, a
    locale, and whether the bot is directed toward children under age 13. You
    can use this to add intents later, or to remove intents from an existing
    bot. When you create a bot with the minimum information, the bot is created
    or updated but Amazon Lex returns the  response FAILED. You can build the
    bot after you add one or more intents. For more information about Amazon Lex
    bots, see how-it-works.  If you specify the name of an existing bot, the
    fields in the request replace the existing values in the $LATEST version of
    the bot. Amazon Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values for in
    the request, except for the idleTTLInSeconds and privacySettings fields,
    which are set to their default values. If you don't specify values for
    required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. This operation requires
    permissions for the lex:PutBot action. For more information, see
    security-iam.
