    Generates pin-related data such as PIN, PIN Verification Value (PVV), PIN
    Block, and PIN Offset during new card issuance or reissuance. For more
    information, see Generate PIN data in the Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography User Guide. PIN data is never transmitted in clear to or from
    Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. This operation generates PIN, PVV,
    or PIN Offset and then encrypts it using Pin Encryption Key (PEK) to create
    an EncryptedPinBlock for transmission from Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography. This operation uses a separate Pin Verification Key (PVK) for
    VISA PVV generation.  For information about valid keys for this operation,
    see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations
    in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.  Cross-account
    use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services
