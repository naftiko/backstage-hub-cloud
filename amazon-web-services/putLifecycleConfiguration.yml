  description: >-
    Use this action to manage storage for your file system. A
    LifecycleConfiguration consists of one or more LifecyclePolicy objects that
    define the following:     TransitionToIA  – When to move files in the file
    system from primary storage (Standard storage class) into the Infrequent
    Access (IA) storage.     TransitionToArchive  – When to move files in the
    file system from their current storage class (either IA or Standard storage)
    into the Archive storage. File systems cannot transition into Archive
    storage before transitioning into IA storage. Therefore, TransitionToArchive
    must either not be set or must be later than TransitionToIA.   The Archive
    storage class is available only for file systems that use the Elastic
    Throughput mode and the General Purpose Performance mode.        
    TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass  – Whether to move files in the file system
    back to primary storage (Standard storage class) after they are accessed in
    IA or Archive storage.   For more information, see  Managing file system
    storage. Each Amazon EFS file system supports one lifecycle configuration,
    which applies to all files in the file system. If a LifecycleConfiguration
    object already exists for the specified file system, a
    PutLifecycleConfiguration call modifies the existing configuration. A
    PutLifecycleConfiguration call with an empty LifecyclePolicies array in the
    request body deletes any existing LifecycleConfiguration. In the request,
    specify the following:    The ID for the file system for which you are
    enabling, disabling, or modifying Lifecycle management.   A
    LifecyclePolicies array of LifecyclePolicy objects that define when to move
    files to IA storage, to Archive storage, and back to primary storage. 
    Amazon EFS requires that each LifecyclePolicy object have only have a single
    transition, so the LifecyclePolicies array needs to be structured with
    separate LifecyclePolicy objects. See the example requests in the following
    section for more information.    This operation requires permissions for the
    elasticfilesystem:PutLifecycleConfiguration operation. To apply a
    LifecycleConfiguration object to an encrypted file system, you need the same
    Key Management Service permissions as when you created the encrypted file
    system.
