    A practice run configuration for zonal autoshift is required when you enable
    zonal autoshift. A practice run configuration includes specifications for
    blocked dates and blocked time windows, and for Amazon CloudWatch alarms
    that you create to use with practice runs. The alarms that you specify are
    an outcome alarm, to monitor application health during practice runs and,
    optionally, a blocking alarm, to block practice runs from starting. For more
    information, see  Considerations when you configure zonal autoshift in the
    Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
