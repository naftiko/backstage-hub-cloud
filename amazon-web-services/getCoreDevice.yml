    Retrieves metadata for a Greengrass core device.  IoT Greengrass relies on
    individual devices to send status updates to the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
    If the IoT Greengrass Core software isn't running on the device, or if
    device isn't connected to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported
    status of that device might not reflect its current status. The status
    timestamp indicates when the device status was last updated. Core devices
    send status updates at the following times:   When the IoT Greengrass Core
    software starts   When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon
    Web Services Cloud   When the status of any component on the core device
    becomes BROKEN    At a regular interval that you can configure, which
    defaults to 24 hours   For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends
    status updates upon local deployment and cloud deployment
