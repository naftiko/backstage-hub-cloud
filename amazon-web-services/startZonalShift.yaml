    You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away from
    an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help your
    application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code
    deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single
    Availability Zone. You can start a zonal shift in Route 53 ARC only for
    managed resources in your Amazon Web Services account in an Amazon Web
    Services Region. Resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC by
    Amazon Web Services services. At this time, you can only start a zonal shift
    for Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone
    load balancing turned off. When you start a zonal shift, traffic for the
    resource is no longer routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is
    created immediately in Route 53 ARC. However, it can take a short time,
    typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in the
    Availability Zone to complete. For more information, see Zonal shift in the
    Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
