    Start a maintenance window for the specified input device. Starting a
    maintenance window will give the device up to two hours to install software.
    If the device was streaming prior to the maintenance, it will resume
    streaming when the software is fully installed. Devices automatically
    install updates while they are powered on and their MediaLive channels are
    stopped. A maintenance window allows you to update a device without having
    to stop MediaLive channels that use the device. The device must remain
    powered on and connected to the internet for the duration of the
    maintenance.
