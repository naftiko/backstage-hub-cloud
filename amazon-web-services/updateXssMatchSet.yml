  description: ' This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.  For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Inserts or deletes XssMatchTuple objects (filters) in an XssMatchSet. For each XssMatchTuple object, you specify the following values:    Action: Whether to insert the object into or delete the object from the array. To change an XssMatchTuple, you delete the existing object and add a new one.    FieldToMatch: The part of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect and, if you want AWS WAF to inspect a header or custom query parameter, the name of the header or parameter.    TextTransformation: Which text transformation, if any, to perform on the web request before inspecting the request for cross-site scripting attacks. You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.   You use XssMatchSet objects to specify which CloudFront requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, if you''re receiving requests that contain cross-site scripting attacks in the request body and you want to block the requests, you can create an XssMatchSet with the applicable settings, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.  To create and configure an XssMatchSet, perform the following steps:   Submit a CreateXssMatchSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateIPSet request.   Submit an UpdateXssMatchSet request to specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for cross-site scripting attacks.   For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.'
