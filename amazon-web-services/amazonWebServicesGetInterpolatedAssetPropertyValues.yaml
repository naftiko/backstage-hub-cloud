    Get interpolated values for an asset property for a specified time interval,
    during a period of time. If your time series is missing data points during
    the specified time interval, you can use interpolation to estimate the
    missing data. For example, you can use this operation to return the
    interpolated temperature values for a wind turbine every 24 hours over a
    duration of 7 days. To identify an asset property, you must specify one of
    the following:   The assetId and propertyId of an asset property.   A
    propertyAlias, which is a data stream alias (for example,
    /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To define an asset property's
    alias, see UpdateAssetProperty.
