  description: ' This operation is not supported by directory buckets.  Puts a S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket. You can have up to 1,000 S3 Intelligent-Tiering configurations per bucket. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate additional archiving capabilities. The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. For more information, see Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed objects. Operations related to PutBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration include:     DeleteBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration     GetBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration     ListBucketIntelligentTieringConfigurations     You only need S3 Intelligent-Tiering enabled on a bucket if you want to automatically move objects stored in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tier.   PutBucketIntelligentTieringConfiguration has the following special errors:  HTTP 400 Bad Request Error   Code: InvalidArgument  Cause: Invalid Argument  HTTP 400 Bad Request Error   Code: TooManyConfigurations  Cause: You are attempting to create a new configuration but have already reached the 1,000-configuration limit.   HTTP 403 Forbidden Error   Cause: You are not the owner of the specified bucket, or you do not have the s3:PutIntelligentTieringConfiguration bucket permission to set the configuration on the bucket.
