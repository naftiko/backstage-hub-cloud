    Updates the status of the specified certificate. This operation is
    idempotent. Requires permission to access the UpdateCertificate action.
    Certificates must be in the ACTIVE state to authenticate devices that use a
    certificate to connect to IoT. Within a few minutes of updating a
    certificate from the ACTIVE state to any other state, IoT disconnects all
    devices that used that certificate to connect. Devices cannot use a
    certificate that is not in the ACTIVE state to reconnect.
