  name: deletearchive
  description: >-
    This operation deletes an archive from a vault. Subsequent requests to
    initiate a retrieval of this archive will fail. Archive retrievals that are
    in progress for this archive ID may or may not succeed according to the
    following scenarios:   If the archive retrieval job is actively preparing
    the data for download when Amazon S3 Glacier receives the delete archive
    request, the archival retrieval operation might fail.   If the archive
    retrieval job has successfully prepared the archive for download when Amazon
    S3 Glacier receives the delete archive request, you will be able to download
    the output.   This operation is idempotent. Attempting to delete an
    already-deleted archive does not result in an error. An AWS account has full
    permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and
    Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You
    must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more
    information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management
    (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Deleting an
    Archive in Amazon Glacier and Delete Archive in the Amazon Glacier Developer
    Guide.
