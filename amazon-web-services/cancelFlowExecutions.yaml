    Cancels active runs for a flow. You can cancel all of the active runs for a
    flow, or you can cancel specific runs by providing their IDs. You can cancel
    a flow run only when the run is in progress. You can't cancel a run that has
    already completed or failed. You also can't cancel a run that's scheduled to
    occur but hasn't started yet. To prevent a scheduled run, you can deactivate
    the flow with the StopFlow action. You cannot resume a run after you cancel
    it. When you send your request, the status for each run becomes
    CancelStarted. When the cancellation completes, the status becomes
    Canceled.  When you cancel a run, you still incur charges for any data that
    the run already processed before the cancellation. If the run had already
    written some data to the flow destination, then that data remains in the
    destination. If you configured the flow to use a batch API (such as the
    Salesforce Bulk API 2.0), then the run will finish reading or writing its
    entire batch of data after the cancellation. For these operations, the data
    processing charges for Amazon AppFlow apply. For the pricing information,
    see Amazon AppFlow pricing.
