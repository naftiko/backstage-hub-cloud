    Enables Health to work with Organizations. You can use the organizational
    view feature to aggregate events from all Amazon Web Services accounts in
    your organization in a centralized location.  This operation also creates a
    service-linked role for the management account in the organization.   To
    call this operation, you must meet the following requirements:   You must
    have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from Amazon
    Web Services Support to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from
    an Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise
    On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
    SubscriptionRequiredException error.   You must have permission to call this
    operation from the organization's management account. For example IAM
    policies, see Health identity-based policy examples.    If you don't have
    the required support plan, you can instead use the Health console to enable
    the organizational view feature. For more information, see Aggregating
    Health events in the Health User Guide.
