    Updates stream metadata, such as the device name and media type. You must
    provide the stream name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream. To
    make sure that you have the latest version of the stream before updating it,
    you can specify the stream version. Kinesis Video Streams assigns a version
    to each stream. When you update a stream, Kinesis Video Streams assigns a
    new version number. To get the latest stream version, use the DescribeStream
    API.   UpdateStream is an asynchronous operation, and takes time to
    complete.
