  description: >-
    When a contact is being recorded, this API suspends recording whatever is
    selected in the flow configuration: call, screen, or both. If only call
    recording or only screen recording is enabled, then it would be suspended.
    For example, you might suspend the screen recording while collecting
    sensitive information, such as a credit card number. Then use
    ResumeContactRecording to restart recording the screen. The period of time
    that the recording is suspended is filled with silence in the final
    recording. Voice and screen recordings are supported.
