    Verifies Authorization Request Cryptogram (ARQC) for a EMV chip payment card
    authorization. For more information, see Verify auth request cryptogram in
    the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. ARQC generation is
    done outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and is typically
    generated on a point of sale terminal for an EMV chip card to obtain payment
    authorization during transaction time. For ARQC verification, you must first
    import the ARQC generated outside of Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography by calling ImportKey. This operation uses the imported ARQC and
    an major encryption key (DUKPT) created by calling CreateKey to either
    provide a boolean ARQC verification result or provide an APRC (Authorization
    Response Cryptogram) response using Method 1 or Method 2. The ARPC_METHOD_1
    uses AuthResponseCode to generate ARPC and ARPC_METHOD_2 uses
    CardStatusUpdate to generate ARPC.  For information about valid keys for
    this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific
    data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.
