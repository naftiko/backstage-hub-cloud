    Connects a Kubernetes cluster to the Amazon EKS control plane.  Any
    Kubernetes cluster can be connected to the Amazon EKS control plane to view
    current information about the cluster and its nodes.  Cluster connection
    requires two steps. First, send a  RegisterClusterRequest  to add it to the
    Amazon EKS control plane. Second, a Manifest containing the activationID and
    activationCode must be applied to the Kubernetes cluster through it's native
    provider to provide visibility. After the manifest is updated and applied,
    the connected cluster is visible to the Amazon EKS control plane. If the
    manifest isn't applied within three days, the connected cluster will no
    longer be visible and must be deregistered using DeregisterCluster.
