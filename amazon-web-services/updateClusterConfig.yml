  description: >-
    Updates an Amazon EKS cluster configuration. Your cluster continues to
    function during the update. The response output includes an update ID that
    you can use to track the status of your cluster update with
    DescribeUpdate"/&gt;. You can use this API operation to enable or disable
    exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch
    Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch
    Logs. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster control plane logs in
    the  Amazon EKS User Guide .  CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage,
    and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more
    information, see CloudWatch Pricing.  You can also use this API operation to
    enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API
    server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is
    disabled. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access
    control in the  Amazon EKS User Guide . You can also use this API operation
    to choose different subnets and security groups for the cluster. You must
    specify at least two subnets that are in different Availability Zones. You
    can't change which VPC the subnets are from, the subnets must be in the same
    VPC as the subnets that the cluster was created with. For more information
    about the VPC requirements, see
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html in the 
    Amazon EKS User Guide . Cluster updates are asynchronous, and they should
    finish within a few minutes. During an update, the cluster status moves to
    UPDATING (this status transition is eventually consistent). When the update
    is complete (either Failed or Successful), the cluster status moves to
    Active.
