    Disassociates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) from an Amazon
    Route 53 private hosted zone. Note the following:   You can't disassociate
    the last Amazon VPC from a private hosted zone.   You can't convert a
    private hosted zone into a public hosted zone.   You can submit a
    DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone request using either the account that created
    the hosted zone or the account that created the Amazon VPC.   Some services,
    such as Cloud Map and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) automatically
    create hosted zones and associate VPCs with the hosted zones. A service can
    create a hosted zone using your account or using its own account. You can
    disassociate a VPC from a hosted zone only if the service created the hosted
    zone using your account. When you run DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone, if the
    hosted zone has a value for OwningAccount, you can use
    DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone. If the hosted zone has a value for
    OwningService, you can't use DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone.    When revoking
    access, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the same
    partition. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each
    Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition. The following are
    the supported partitions:    aws - Amazon Web Services Regions    aws-cn -
    China Regions    aws-us-gov - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region   For
    more information, see Access Management in the Amazon Web Services General
    Reference.
