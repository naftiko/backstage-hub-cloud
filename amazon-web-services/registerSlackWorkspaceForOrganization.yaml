    Registers a Slack workspace for your Amazon Web Services account. To call
    this API, your account must be part of an organization in Organizations. If
    you're the management account and you want to register Slack workspaces for
    your organization, you must complete the following tasks:   Sign in to the
    Amazon Web Services Support Center and authorize the Slack workspaces where
    you want your organization to have access to. See Authorize a Slack
    workspace in the Amazon Web Services Support User Guide.   Call the
    RegisterSlackWorkspaceForOrganization API to authorize each Slack workspace
    for the organization.   After the management account authorizes the Slack
    workspace, member accounts can call this API to authorize the same Slack
    workspace for their individual accounts. Member accounts don't need to
    authorize the Slack workspace manually through the Amazon Web Services
    Support Center. To use the Amazon Web Services Support App, each account
    must then complete the following tasks:   Create an Identity and Access
    Management (IAM) role with the required permission. For more information,
    see Managing access to the Amazon Web Services Support App.   Configure a
    Slack channel to use the Amazon Web Services Support App for support cases
    for that account. For more information, see Configuring a Slack channel.
