    Deletes one or more versions of a recipe at a time. The entire request will
    be rejected if:   The recipe does not exist.   There is an invalid version
    identifier in the list of versions.   The version list is empty.   The
    version list size exceeds 50.   The version list contains duplicate
    entries.   The request will complete successfully, but with partial
    failures, if:   A version does not exist.   A version is being used by a
    job.   You specify LATEST_WORKING, but it's being used by a project.   The
    version fails to be deleted.   The LATEST_WORKING version will only be
    deleted if the recipe has no other versions. If you try to delete
    LATEST_WORKING while other versions exist (or if they can't be deleted),
    then LATEST_WORKING will be listed as partial failure in the response.
