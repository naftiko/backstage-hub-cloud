  description: >-
    Deletes all versions of the bot, including the $LATEST version. To delete a
    specific version of the bot, use the DeleteBotVersion operation. The
    DeleteBot operation doesn't immediately remove the bot schema. Instead, it
    is marked for deletion and removed later. Amazon Lex stores utterances
    indefinitely for improving the ability of your bot to respond to user
    inputs. These utterances are not removed when the bot is deleted. To remove
    the utterances, use the DeleteUtterances operation. If a bot has an alias,
    you can't delete it. Instead, the DeleteBot operation returns a
    ResourceInUseException exception that includes a reference to the alias that
    refers to the bot. To remove the reference to the bot, delete the alias. If
    you get the same exception again, delete the referring alias until the
    DeleteBot operation is successful. This operation requires permissions for
    the lex:DeleteBot action.
