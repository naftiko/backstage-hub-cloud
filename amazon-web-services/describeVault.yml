  name: Describevault
  description: >-
    This operation returns information about a vault, including the vault's
    Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the date the vault was created, the number of
    archives it contains, and the total size of all the archives in the vault.
    The number of archives and their total size are as of the last inventory
    generation. This means that if you add or remove an archive from a vault,
    and then immediately use Describe Vault, the change in contents will not be
    immediately reflected. If you want to retrieve the latest inventory of the
    vault, use InitiateJob. Amazon S3 Glacier generates vault inventories
    approximately daily. For more information, see Downloading a Vault Inventory
    in Amazon S3 Glacier.  An AWS account has full permission to perform all
    operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
    permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access
    Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For conceptual
    information and underlying REST API, see Retrieving Vault Metadata in Amazon
    S3 Glacier and Describe Vault  in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.
