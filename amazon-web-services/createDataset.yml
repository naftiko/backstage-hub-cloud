    can create a training or a test dataset from a valid dataset source
    (DatasetSource). If you want a single dataset project, specify train for the
    value of DatasetType. To have a project with separate training and test
    datasets, call CreateDataset twice. On the first call, specify train for the
    value of DatasetType. On the second call, specify test for the value of
    DatasetType.  This operation requires permissions to perform the
    lookoutvision:CreateDataset operation.
