    Updates connectivity information for a Greengrass core device. Connectivity
    information includes endpoints and ports where client devices can connect to
    an MQTT broker on the core device. When a client device calls the IoT
    Greengrass discovery API, IoT Greengrass returns connectivity information
    for all of the core devices where the client device can connect. For more
    information, see Connect client devices to core devices in the IoT
    Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide.
