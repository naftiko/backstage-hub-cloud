    Starts the running of the version of an Amazon Lookout for Vision model.
    Starting a model takes a while to complete. To check the current state of
    the model, use DescribeModel. A model is ready to use when its status is
    HOSTED. Once the model is running, you can detect custom labels in new
    images by calling DetectAnomalies.  You are charged for the amount of time
    that the model is running. To stop a running model, call StopModel.  This
    operation requires permissions to perform the lookoutvision:StartModel
    operation.
