    Updates a Lambda function's code. If code signing is enabled for the
    function, the code package must be signed by a trusted publisher. For more
    information, see Configuring code signing for Lambda. If the function's
    package type is Image, then you must specify the code package in ImageUri as
    the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. If the function's
    package type is Zip, then you must specify the deployment package as a .zip
    file archive. Enter the Amazon S3 bucket and key of the code .zip file
    location. You can also provide the function code inline using the ZipFile
    field. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target
    instruction set architecture of the function (x86-64 or arm64). The
    function's code is locked when you publish a version. You can't modify the
    code of a published version, only the unpublished version.  For a function
    defined as a container image, Lambda resolves the image tag to an image
    digest. In Amazon ECR, if you update the image tag to a new image, Lambda
    does not automatically update the function.
