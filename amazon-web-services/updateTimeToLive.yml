  description: >-
    The UpdateTimeToLive method enables or disables Time to Live (TTL) for the
    specified table. A successful UpdateTimeToLive call returns the current
    TimeToLiveSpecification. It can take up to one hour for the change to fully
    process. Any additional UpdateTimeToLive calls for the same table during
    this one hour duration result in a ValidationException.  TTL compares the
    current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of
    an item. If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less than the
    current time, the item is marked as expired and subsequently deleted.   The
    epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January
    1, 1970 UTC.   DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to
    ensure availability of throughput for other data operations.   DynamoDB
    typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact
    duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to
    the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted
    will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.  As items are deleted, they
    are removed from any local secondary index and global secondary index
    immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard delete
    operation. For more information, see Time To Live in the Amazon DynamoDB
    Developer Guide.
