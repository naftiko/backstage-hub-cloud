    Turns on Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer in the Amazon Web Services
    Region in which you called this operation by creating an index. Resource
    Explorer begins discovering the resources in this Region and stores the
    details about the resources in the index so that they can be queried by
    using the Search operation. You can create only one index in a Region.  This
    operation creates only a local index. To promote the local index in one
    Amazon Web Services Region into the aggregator index for the Amazon Web
    Services account, use the UpdateIndexType operation. For more information,
    see Turning on cross-Region search by creating an aggregator index in the
    Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide.  For more details about
    what happens when you turn on Resource Explorer in an Amazon Web Services
    Region, see Turn on Resource Explorer to index your resources in an Amazon
    Web Services Region in the Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer User Guide.
    If this is the first Amazon Web Services Region in which you've created an
    index for Resource Explorer, then this operation also creates a
    service-linked role in your Amazon Web Services account that allows Resource
    Explorer to enumerate your resources to populate the index.    Action:
    resource-explorer-2:CreateIndex   Resource: The ARN of the index (as it will
    exist after the operation completes) in the Amazon Web Services Region and
    account in which you're trying to create the index. Use the wildcard
    character (*) at the end of the string to match the eventual UUID. For
    example, the following Resource element restricts the role or user to
    creating an index in only the us-east-2 Region of the specified account. 
    "Resource":
    "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:&lt;account-id&gt;:index/*" 
    Alternatively, you can use "Resource": "*" to allow the role or user to
    create an index in any Region.    Action: iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole  
    Resource: No specific resource (*).  This permission is required only the
    first time you create an index to turn on Resource Explorer in the account.
    Resource Explorer uses this to create the service-linked role needed to
    index the resources in your account. Resource Explorer uses the same
    service-linked role for all additional indexes you create afterwards.
