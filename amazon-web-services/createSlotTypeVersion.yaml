    Creates a new version of a slot type based on the $LATEST version of the
    specified slot type. If the $LATEST version of this resource has not changed
    since the last version that you created, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new
    version. It returns the last version that you created.   You can update only
    the $LATEST version of a slot type. You can't update the numbered versions
    that you create with the CreateSlotTypeVersion operation.  When you create a
    version of a slot type, Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent
    versions increment by 1. For more information, see versioning-intro.  This
    operation requires permissions for the lex:CreateSlotTypeVersion action.
