    Executes a Gremlin Explain query. Amazon Neptune has added a Gremlin feature
    named explain that provides is a self-service tool for understanding the
    execution approach being taken by the Neptune engine for the query. You
    invoke it by adding an explain parameter to an HTTP call that submits a
    Gremlin query. The explain feature provides information about the logical
    structure of query execution plans. You can use this information to identify
    potential evaluation and execution bottlenecks and to tune your query, as
    explained in Tuning Gremlin queries. You can also use query hints to improve
    query execution plans. When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster
    that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request
    must have a policy attached that allows one of the following IAM actions in
    that cluster, depending on the query:    neptune-db:ReadDataViaQuery    
    neptune-db:WriteDataViaQuery     neptune-db:DeleteDataViaQuery    Note that
    the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin IAM condition key can be used in the
    policy document to restrict the use of Gremlin queries (see Condition keys
    available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
