  description: ' This action puts tags on an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put tags on an S3 bucket, see PutBucketTagging in the Amazon S3 API Reference.   Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see Cost allocation and tagging.  Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value. For more information, see  Using cost allocation in Amazon S3 bucket tags.  To use this action, you must have permissions to perform the s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging action. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see  Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing access permissions to your Amazon S3 resources.  PutBucketTagging has the following special errors:   Error code: InvalidTagError    Description: The tag provided was not a valid tag. This error can occur if the tag did not pass input validation. For information about tag restrictions, see  User-Defined Tag Restrictions and  Amazon Web Services-Generated Cost Allocation Tag Restrictions.     Error code: MalformedXMLError    Description: The XML provided does not match the schema.     Error code: OperationAbortedError     Description: A conflicting conditional action is currently in progress against this resource. Try again.     Error code: InternalError    Description: The service was unable to apply the provided tag to the bucket.     All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control.
