    Creates and returns a URL that you can use to access the application UIs for
    a job run. For jobs in a running state, the application UI is a live user
    interface such as the Spark or Tez web UI. For completed jobs, the
    application UI is a persistent application user interface such as the Spark
    History Server or persistent Tez UI.  The URL is valid for one hour after
    you generate it. To access the application UI after that hour elapses, you
    must invoke the API again to generate a new URL.
