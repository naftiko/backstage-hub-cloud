    Removes a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security Lake
    source. You can remove a source for one or more Regions. When you remove the
    source, Security Lake stops collecting data from that source in the
    specified Regions and accounts, and subscribers can no longer consume new
    data from the source. However, subscribers can still consume data that
    Security Lake collected from the source before removal. You can choose any
    source type in any Amazon Web Services Region for either accounts that are
    part of a trusted organization or standalone accounts.
