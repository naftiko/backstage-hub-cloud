  description: >-
    Creates the participant's connection.    ParticipantToken is used for
    invoking this API instead of ConnectionToken.  The participant token is
    valid for the lifetime of the participant – until they are part of a
    contact. The response URL for WEBSOCKET Type has a connect expiry timeout of
    100s. Clients must manually connect to the returned websocket URL and
    subscribe to the desired topic.  For chat, you need to publish the following
    on the established websocket connection: 
    {"topic":"aws/subscribe","content":{"topics":["aws/chat"]}}  Upon websocket
    URL expiry, as specified in the response ConnectionExpiry parameter, clients
    need to call this API again to obtain a new websocket URL and perform the
    same steps as before.  Message streaming support: This API can also be used
    together with the StartContactStreaming API to create a participant
    connection for chat contacts that are not using a websocket. For more
    information about message streaming, Enable real-time chat message streaming
    in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.  Feature specifications: For
    information about feature specifications, such as the allowed number of open
    websocket connections per participant, see Feature specifications in the
    Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.   The Amazon Connect Participant Service
    APIs do not use Signature Version 4 authentication.
