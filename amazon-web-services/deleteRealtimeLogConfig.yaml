    Deletes a real-time log configuration. You cannot delete a real-time log
    configuration if it's attached to a cache behavior. First update your
    distributions to remove the real-time log configuration from all cache
    behaviors, then delete the real-time log configuration. To delete a
    real-time log configuration, you can provide the configuration's name or its
    Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least one. If you provide
    both, CloudFront uses the name to identify the real-time log configuration
    to delete.
