  description: ' This operation is not supported by directory buckets.  This implementation of the PUT action adds an inventory configuration (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket. You can have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.  Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is inventoried is called the source bucket, and the bucket where the inventory flat file is stored is called the destination bucket. The destination bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source bucket.  When you configure an inventory for a source bucket, you specify the destination bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and whether to generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current versions. For more information, see Amazon S3 Inventory in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  You must create a bucket policy on the destination bucket to grant permissions to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an example policy, see  Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class Analysis.   Permissions  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the s3:PutInventoryConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others.  The s3:PutInventoryConfiguration permission allows a user to create an S3 Inventory report that includes all object metadata fields available and to specify the destination bucket to store the inventory. A user with read access to objects in the destination bucket can also access all object metadata fields that are available in the inventory report.  To restrict access to an inventory report, see Restricting access to an Amazon S3 Inventory report in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the metadata fields available in S3 Inventory, see Amazon S3 Inventory lists in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about permissions, see Permissions related to bucket subresource operations and Identity and access management in Amazon S3 in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
