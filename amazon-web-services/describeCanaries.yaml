    This operation returns a list of the canaries in your account, along with
    full details about each canary. This operation supports resource-level
    authorization using an IAM policy and the Names parameter. If you specify
    the Names parameter, the operation is successful only if you have
    authorization to view all the canaries that you specify in your request. If
    you do not have permission to view any of the canaries, the request fails
    with a 403 response. You are required to use the Names parameter if you are
    logged on to a user or role that has an IAM policy that restricts which
    canaries that you are allowed to view. For more information, see  Limiting a
    user to viewing specific canaries.
