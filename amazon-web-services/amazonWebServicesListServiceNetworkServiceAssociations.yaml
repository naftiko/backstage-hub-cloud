    Lists the associations between the service network and the service. You can
    filter the list either by service or service network. You must provide
    either the service network identifier or the service identifier. Every
    association in Amazon VPC Lattice is given a unique Amazon Resource Name
    (ARN), such as when a service network is associated with a VPC or when a
    service is associated with a service network. If the association is for a
    resource that is shared with another account, the association will include
    the local account ID as the prefix in the ARN for each account the resource
    is shared with.
