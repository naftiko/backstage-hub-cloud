  description: >-
    When you attach a resource-based policy to a resource, RAM automatically
    creates a resource share of featureSet=CREATED_FROM_POLICY with a managed
    permission that has the same IAM permissions as the original resource-based
    policy. However, this type of managed permission is visible to only the
    resource share owner, and the associated resource share can't be modified by
    using RAM. This operation promotes the resource share to a STANDARD resource
    share that is fully manageable in RAM. When you promote a resource share,
    you can then manage the resource share in RAM and it becomes visible to all
    of the principals you shared it with.  Before you perform this operation,
    you should first run PromotePermissionCreatedFromPolicyto ensure that you
    have an appropriate customer managed permission that can be associated with
    this resource share after its is promoted. If this operation can't find a
    managed permission that exactly matches the existing CREATED_FROM_POLICY
    permission, then this operation fails.
