    Creates a version from the current code and configuration of a function. Use
    versions to create a snapshot of your function code and configuration that
    doesn't change. Lambda doesn't publish a version if the function's
    configuration and code haven't changed since the last version. Use
    UpdateFunctionCode or UpdateFunctionConfiguration to update the function
    before publishing a version. Clients can invoke versions directly or with an
    alias. To create an alias, use CreateAlias.
