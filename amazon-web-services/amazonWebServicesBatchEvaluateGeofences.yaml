    Evaluates device positions against the geofence geometries from a given
    geofence collection. This operation always returns an empty response because
    geofences are asynchronously evaluated. The evaluation determines if the
    device has entered or exited a geofenced area, and then publishes one of the
    following events to Amazon EventBridge:    ENTER if Amazon Location
    determines that the tracked device has entered a geofenced area.    EXIT if
    Amazon Location determines that the tracked device has exited a geofenced
    area.    The last geofence that a device was observed within is tracked for
    30 days after the most recent device position update.   Geofence evaluation
    uses the given device position. It does not account for the optional
    Accuracy of a DevicePositionUpdate.   The DeviceID is used as a string to
    represent the device. You do not need to have a Tracker associated with the
    DeviceID.
