    Migrates 10 active and enabled Amazon SNS subscriptions at a time and
    converts them to corresponding Amazon EventBridge rules. By default, this
    operation migrates subscriptions only when all your replication instance
    versions are 3.4.5 or higher. If any replication instances are from versions
    earlier than 3.4.5, the operation raises an error and tells you to upgrade
    these instances to version 3.4.5 or higher. To enable migration regardless
    of version, set the Force option to true. However, if you don't upgrade
    instances earlier than version 3.4.5, some types of events might not be
    available when you use Amazon EventBridge. To call this operation, make sure
    that you have certain permissions added to your user account. For more
    information, see Migrating event subscriptions to Amazon EventBridge in the
    Amazon Web Services Database Migration Service User Guide.
