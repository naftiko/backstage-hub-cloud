  description: >-
    Creates a component. Components are software that run on Greengrass core
    devices. After you develop and test a component on your core device, you can
    use this operation to upload your component to IoT Greengrass. Then, you can
    deploy the component to other core devices. You can use this operation to do
    the following:    Create components from recipes  Create a component from a
    recipe, which is a file that defines the component's metadata, parameters,
    dependencies, lifecycle, artifacts, and platform capability. For more
    information, see IoT Greengrass component recipe reference in the IoT
    Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. To create a component from a recipe, specify
    inlineRecipe when you call this operation.    Create components from Lambda
    functions  Create a component from an Lambda function that runs on IoT
    Greengrass. This creates a recipe and artifacts from the Lambda function's
    deployment package. You can use this operation to migrate Lambda functions
    from IoT Greengrass V1 to IoT Greengrass V2. This function only accepts
    Lambda functions that use the following runtimes:   Python 2.7 –
    python2.7    Python 3.7 – python3.7    Python 3.8 – python3.8    Python 3.9
    – python3.9    Java 8 – java8    Java 11 – java11    Node.js 10 –
    nodejs10.x    Node.js 12 – nodejs12.x    Node.js 14 – nodejs14.x    To
    create a component from a Lambda function, specify lambdaFunction when you
    call this operation.  IoT Greengrass currently supports Lambda functions on
    only Linux core devices.
