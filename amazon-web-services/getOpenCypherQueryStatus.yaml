    Retrieves the status of a specified openCypher query. When invoking this
    operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM
    user or role making the request must have a policy attached that allows the
    neptune-db:GetQueryStatus IAM action in that cluster. Note that the
    neptune-db:QueryLanguage:OpenCypher IAM condition key can be used in the
    policy document to restrict the use of openCypher queries (see Condition
    keys available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
