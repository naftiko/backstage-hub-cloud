  description: >-
    Creates a new version of an intent based on the $LATEST version of the
    intent. If the $LATEST version of this intent hasn't changed since you last
    updated it, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last
    version you created.  You can update only the $LATEST version of the intent.
    You can't update the numbered versions that you create with the
    CreateIntentVersion operation.   When you create a version of an intent,
    Amazon Lex sets the version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For
    more information, see versioning-intro.  This operation requires permissions
    to perform the lex:CreateIntentVersion action.
