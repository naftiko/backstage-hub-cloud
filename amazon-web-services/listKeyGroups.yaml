    Gets a list of key groups. You can optionally specify the maximum number of
    items to receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list
    exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response
    is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that
    specifies the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker value
    in the subsequent request.
