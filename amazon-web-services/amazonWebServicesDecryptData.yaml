  description: >-
    Decrypts ciphertext data to plaintext using symmetric, asymmetric, or DUKPT
    data encryption key. For more information, see Decrypt data in the Amazon
    Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. You can use an encryption key
    generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, or you can import
    your own encryption key by calling ImportKey. For this operation, the key
    must have KeyModesOfUse set to Decrypt. In asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web
    Services Payment Cryptography decrypts the ciphertext using the private
    component of the asymmetric encryption key pair. For data encryption outside
    of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can export the public
    component of the asymmetric key pair by calling GetPublicCertificate. For
    symmetric and DUKPT decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
    supports TDES and AES algorithms. For asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web
    Services Payment Cryptography supports RSA. When you use DUKPT, for TDES
    algorithm, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For
    AES algorithm, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 32 bytes.
    For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key
    attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web
    Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.   Cross-account use: This
    operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.
