    Gets information about all of the versions of an intent. The
    GetIntentVersions operation returns an IntentMetadata object for each
    version of an intent. For example, if an intent has three numbered versions,
    the GetIntentVersions operation returns four IntentMetadata objects in the
    response, one for each numbered version and one for the $LATEST version. 
    The GetIntentVersions operation always returns at least one version, the
    $LATEST version. This operation requires permissions for the
    lex:GetIntentVersions action.
