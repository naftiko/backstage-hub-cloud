    Returns a list of image scan aggregations for your account. You can filter
    by the type of key that Image Builder uses to group results. For example, if
    you want to get a list of findings by severity level for one of your
    pipelines, you might specify your pipeline with the imagePipelineArn filter.
    If you don't specify a filter, Image Builder returns an aggregation for your
    account. To streamline results, you can use the following filters in your
    request:    accountId     imageBuildVersionArn     imagePipelineArn    
    vulnerabilityId
