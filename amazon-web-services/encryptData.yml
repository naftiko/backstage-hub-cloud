  description: >-
    Encrypts plaintext data to ciphertext using symmetric, asymmetric, or DUKPT
    data encryption key. For more information, see Encrypt data in the Amazon
    Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. You can generate an encryption
    key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling CreateKey.
    You can import your own encryption key by calling ImportKey. For this
    operation, the key must have KeyModesOfUse set to Encrypt. In asymmetric
    encryption, plaintext is encrypted using public component. You can import
    the public component of an asymmetric key pair created outside Amazon Web
    Services Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey).  for symmetric and
    DUKPT encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES and
    AES algorithms. For asymmetric encryption, Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography supports RSA. To encrypt using DUKPT, you must already have a
    DUKPT key in your account with KeyModesOfUse set to DeriveKey, or you can
    generate a new DUKPT key by calling CreateKey. For information about valid
    keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for
    specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
    User Guide.  Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across
    different Amazon Web Services accounts.  Related operations:
