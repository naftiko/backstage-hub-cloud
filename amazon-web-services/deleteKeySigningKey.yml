    Deletes a key-signing key (KSK). Before you can delete a KSK, you must
    deactivate it. The KSK must be deactivated before you can delete it
    regardless of whether the hosted zone is enabled for DNSSEC signing. You can
    use DeactivateKeySigningKey to deactivate the key before you delete it. Use
    GetDNSSEC to verify that the KSK is in an INACTIVE status.
