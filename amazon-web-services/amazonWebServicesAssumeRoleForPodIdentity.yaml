    The Amazon EKS Auth API and the AssumeRoleForPodIdentity action are only
    used by the EKS Pod Identity Agent. We recommend that applications use the
    Amazon Web Services SDKs to connect to Amazon Web Services services; if
    credentials from an EKS Pod Identity association are available in the pod,
    the latest versions of the SDKs use them automatically.
