  description: ' The BatchCreateTableRows API allows you to create one or more rows at the end of a table in a workbook. The API allows you to specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in the new rows.   If a column is not explicitly set in a specific row, then the column level formula specified in the table will be applied to the new row. If there is no column level formula but the last row of the table has a formula, then that formula will be copied down to the new row. If there is no column level formula and no formula in the last row of the table, then that column will be left blank for the new rows. '
