  name: Deleteedgeconfiguration
  description: >-
    An asynchronous API that deletes a stream’s existing edge configuration, as
    well as the corresponding media from the Edge Agent. When you invoke this
    API, the sync status is set to DELETING. A deletion process starts, in which
    active edge jobs are stopped and all media is deleted from the edge device.
    The time to delete varies, depending on the total amount of stored media. If
    the deletion process fails, the sync status changes to DELETE_FAILED. You
    will need to re-try the deletion. When the deletion process has completed
    successfully, the edge configuration is no longer accessible.
