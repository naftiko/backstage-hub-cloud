    Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single ChangeSet,
    you can't start the same change type against the same entity multiple times.
    Additionally, when a ChangeSet is running, all the entities targeted by the
    different changes are locked until the change set has completed (either
    succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try to start a change set
    containing a change against an entity that is already locked, you will
    receive a ResourceInUseException error. For example, you can't start the
    ChangeSet described in the example later in this topic because it contains
    two changes to run the same change type (AddRevisions) against the same
    entity (entity-id@1). For more information about working with change sets,
    see  Working with change sets. For information about change types for
    single-AMI products, see Working with single-AMI products. Also, for more
    information about change types available for container-based products, see
    Working with container products.
