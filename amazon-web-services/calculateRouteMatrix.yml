  description: '  Calculates a route matrix given the following required parameters: DeparturePositions and DestinationPositions. CalculateRouteMatrix calculates routes and returns the travel time and travel distance from each departure position to each destination position in the request. For example, given departure positions A and B, and destination positions X and Y, CalculateRouteMatrix will return time and distance for routes from A to X, A to Y, B to X, and B to Y (in that order). The number of results returned (and routes calculated) will be the number of DeparturePositions times the number of DestinationPositions.  Your account is charged for each route calculated, not the number of requests.  Requires that you first create a route calculator resource. By default, a request that doesn''t specify a departure time uses the best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calculating routes. Additional options include:     Specifying a departure time using either DepartureTime or DepartNow. This calculates routes based on predictive traffic data at the given time.   You can''t specify both DepartureTime and DepartNow in a single request. Specifying both parameters returns a validation error.     Specifying a travel mode using TravelMode sets the transportation mode used to calculate the routes. This also lets you specify additional route preferences in CarModeOptions if traveling by Car, or TruckModeOptions if traveling by Truck.  '
