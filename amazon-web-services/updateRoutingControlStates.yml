    Set multiple routing control states. You can set the value for each state to
    be ON or OFF. When the state is ON, traffic flows to a cell. When it's OFF,
    traffic does not flow. With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for
    routing controls, which are safeguards for routing control state updates
    that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail open traffic routing.
    However, there are scenarios when you might want to bypass the routing
    control safeguards that are enforced with safety rules that you've
    configured. For example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster
    recovery, and one or more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you
    from updating a routing control state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass"
    scenario like this, you can override one or more safety rules to change a
    routing control state and fail over your application. The
    SafetyRulesToOverride property enables you override one or more safety rules
    and update routing control states. For more information, see  Override
    safety rules to reroute traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
    Controller Developer Guide.  You must specify Regional endpoints when you
    work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in
    Route 53 ARC.  To see a code example for getting a routing control state,
    including accessing Regional cluster endpoints in sequence, see API examples
    in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
