  description: ' To use this API operation, your IAM role must have permissions to perform the ListAggregatedUtterances operation, which provides access to utterance-related analytics. See Viewing utterance statistics for the IAM policy to apply to the IAM role.  Retrieves summary metrics for the utterances in your bot. The following fields are required:    metrics – A list of AnalyticsUtteranceMetric objects. In each object, use the name field to specify the metric to calculate, the statistic field to specify whether to calculate the Sum, Average, or Max number, and the order field to specify whether to sort the results in Ascending or Descending order.    startDateTime and endDateTime – Define a time range for which you want to retrieve results.   Of the optional fields, you can organize the results in the following ways:   Use the filters field to filter the results, the groupBy field to specify categories by which to group the results, and the binBy field to specify time intervals by which to group the results.   Use the maxResults field to limit the number of results to return in a single response and the nextToken field to return the next batch of results if the response does not return the full set of results.   Note that an order field exists in both binBy and metrics. Currently, you can specify it in either field, but not in both.'
