  description: >-
    Executes a Gremlin Profile query, which runs a specified traversal, collects
    various metrics about the run, and produces a profile report as output. See
    Gremlin profile API in Neptune for details. When invoking this operation in
    a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role
    making the request must have a policy attached that allows the
    neptune-db:ReadDataViaQuery IAM action in that cluster. Note that the
    neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin IAM condition key can be used in the policy
    document to restrict the use of Gremlin queries (see Condition keys
    available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
