  description: >-
    Creates a snapshot of the specified simulation. A snapshot is a file that
    contains simulation state data at a specific time. The state data saved in a
    snapshot includes entity data from the State Fabric, the simulation
    configuration specified in the schema, and the clock tick number. You can
    use the snapshot to initialize a new simulation. For more information about
    snapshots, see Snapshots in the SimSpace Weaver User Guide.  You specify a
    Destination when you create a snapshot. The Destination is the name of an
    Amazon S3 bucket and an optional ObjectKeyPrefix. The ObjectKeyPrefix is
    usually the name of a folder in the bucket. SimSpace Weaver creates a
    snapshot folder inside the Destination and places the snapshot file there.
    The snapshot file is an Amazon S3 object. It has an object key with the
    form:  object-key-prefix/snapshot/simulation-name-YYMMdd-HHmm-ss.zip,
    where:      YY  is the 2-digit year     MM  is the 2-digit month     dd  is
    the 2-digit day of the month     HH  is the 2-digit hour (24-hour clock)    
    mm  is the 2-digit minutes     ss  is the 2-digit seconds
