    Gets the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) server configuration
    information, including URIs, username, and password which can be used to
    configure the WebRTC connection. The ICE component uses this configuration
    information to setup the WebRTC connection, including authenticating with
    the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) relay server.  TURN is a
    protocol that is used to improve the connectivity of peer-to-peer
    applications. By providing a cloud-based relay service, TURN ensures that a
    connection can be established even when one or more peers are incapable of a
    direct peer-to-peer connection. For more information, see A REST API For
    Access To TURN Services.  You can invoke this API to establish a fallback
    mechanism in case either of the peers is unable to establish a direct
    peer-to-peer connection over a signaling channel. You must specify either a
    signaling channel ARN or the client ID in order to invoke this API.
