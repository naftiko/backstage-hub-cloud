    Starts an Amazon Lookout for Vision model packaging job. A model packaging
    job creates an AWS IoT Greengrass component for a Lookout for Vision model.
    You can use the component to deploy your model to an edge device managed by
    Greengrass.  Use the DescribeModelPackagingJob API to determine the current
    status of the job. The model packaging job is complete if the value of
    Status is SUCCEEDED. To deploy the component to the target device, use the
    component name and component version with the AWS IoT Greengrass
    CreateDeployment API. This operation requires the following permissions:   
    lookoutvision:StartModelPackagingJob     s3:PutObject    
    s3:GetBucketLocation     kms:GenerateDataKey    
    greengrass:CreateComponentVersion     greengrass:DescribeComponent   
    (Optional) greengrass:TagResource. Only required if you want to tag the
    component.   For more information, see Using your Amazon Lookout for Vision
    model on an edge device in the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.
