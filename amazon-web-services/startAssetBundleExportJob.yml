    Starts an Asset Bundle export job. An Asset Bundle export job exports
    specified Amazon QuickSight assets. You can also choose to export any asset
    dependencies in the same job. Export jobs run asynchronously and can be
    polled with a DescribeAssetBundleExportJob API call. When a job is
    successfully completed, a download URL that contains the exported assets is
    returned. The URL is valid for 5 minutes and can be refreshed with a
    DescribeAssetBundleExportJob API call. Each Amazon QuickSight account can
    run up to 5 export jobs concurrently. The API caller must have the necessary
    permissions in their IAM role to access each resource before the resources
    can be exported.
