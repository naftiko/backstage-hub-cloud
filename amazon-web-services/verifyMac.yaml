  description: >-
    Verifies a Message Authentication Code (MAC).  You can use this operation
    when keys won't be shared but mutual data is present on both ends for
    validation. In this case, known data values are used to generate a MAC on
    both ends for verification without sending or receiving data in ciphertext
    or plaintext. You can use this operation to verify a DUPKT, HMAC or EMV MAC
    by setting generation attributes and algorithm to the associated values. Use
    the same encryption key for MAC verification as you use for GenerateMac. 
    For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key
    attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web
    Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.   Cross-account use: This
    operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.
