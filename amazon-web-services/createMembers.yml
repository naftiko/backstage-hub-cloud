  description: ' CreateMembers is used to send invitations to accounts. For the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account uses CreateMembers to enable organization accounts as member accounts. For invited accounts, CreateMembers sends a request to invite the specified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph.   CreateMembers verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, CreateMembers attempts to enable the accounts. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite or to enable. The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:   The accounts that CreateMembers was able to process. For invited accounts, includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, includes accounts that can be enabled and that cannot be enabled.   The accounts that CreateMembers was unable to process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph.  '
