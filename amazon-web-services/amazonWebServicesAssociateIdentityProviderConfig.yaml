    Associates an identity provider configuration to a cluster. If you want to
    authenticate identities using an identity provider, you can create an
    identity provider configuration and associate it to your cluster. After
    configuring authentication to your cluster you can create Kubernetes Role
    and ClusterRole objects, assign permissions to them, and then bind them to
    the identities using Kubernetes RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding objects.
    For more information see Using RBAC Authorization in the Kubernetes
    documentation.
