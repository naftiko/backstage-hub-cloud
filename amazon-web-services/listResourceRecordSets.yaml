    Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone. 
    ListResourceRecordSets returns up to 300 resource record sets at a time in
    ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the name and type
    elements.  Sort order   ListResourceRecordSets sorts results first by DNS
    name with the labels reversed, for example:  com.example.www.  Note the
    trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record name contains
    characters that appear before . (decimal 46) in the ASCII table. These
    characters include the following: ! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , -  When
    multiple records have the same DNS name, ListResourceRecordSets sorts
    results by the record type.  Specifying where to start listing records  You
    can use the name and type elements to specify the resource record set that
    the list begins with:  If you do not specify Name or Type  The results begin
    with the first resource record set that the hosted zone contains.  If you
    specify Name but not Type  The results begin with the first resource record
    set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name.  If you specify
    Type but not Name  Amazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error.  If you
    specify both Name and Type  The results begin with the first resource record
    set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to Name, and whose type
    is greater than or equal to Type.    Resource record sets that are PENDING 
    This action returns the most current version of the records. This includes
    records that are PENDING, and that are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS
    servers.  Changing resource record sets  To ensure that you get an accurate
    listing of the resource record sets for a hosted zone at a point in time, do
    not submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request while you're paging through
    the results of a ListResourceRecordSets request. If you do, some pages may
    display results without the latest changes while other pages display results
    with the latest changes.  Displaying the next page of results  If a
    ListResourceRecordSets command returns more than one page of results, the
    value of IsTruncated is true. To display the next page of results, get the
    values of NextRecordName, NextRecordType, and NextRecordIdentifier (if any)
    from the response. Then submit another ListResourceRecordSets request, and
    specify those values for StartRecordName, StartRecordType, and
    StartRecordIdentifier.
