  description: >-
    Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented applications.
    Services retrieve rules with GetSamplingRules, and evaluate each rule in
    ascending order of priority for each request. If a rule matches, the service
    records a trace, borrowing it from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the
    service reports back to X-Ray with GetSamplingTargets to get updated
    versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a trace quota that
    the service can use instead of borrowing from the reservoir.
