    Use this to create a sink in the current account, so that it can be used as
    a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account observability. A sink is a
    resource that represents an attachment point in a monitoring account. Source
    accounts can link to the sink to send observability data. After you create a
    sink, you must create a sink policy that allows source accounts to attach to
    it. For more information, see PutSinkPolicy. Each account can contain one
    sink. If you delete a sink, you can then create a new one in that account.
