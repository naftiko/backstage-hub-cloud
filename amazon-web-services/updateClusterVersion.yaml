    Updates an Amazon EKS cluster to the specified Kubernetes version. Your
    cluster continues to function during the update. The response output
    includes an update ID that you can use to track the status of your cluster
    update with the DescribeUpdate API operation. Cluster updates are
    asynchronous, and they should finish within a few minutes. During an update,
    the cluster status moves to UPDATING (this status transition is eventually
    consistent). When the update is complete (either Failed or Successful), the
    cluster status moves to Active. If your cluster has managed node groups
    attached to it, all of your node groups’ Kubernetes versions must match the
    cluster’s Kubernetes version in order to update the cluster to a new
    Kubernetes version.
