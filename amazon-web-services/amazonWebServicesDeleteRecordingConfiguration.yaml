    Deletes the recording configuration for the specified ARN. If you try to
    delete a recording configuration that is associated with a channel, you will
    get an error (409 ConflictException). To avoid this, for all channels that
    reference the recording configuration, first use UpdateChannel to set the
    recordingConfigurationArn field to an empty string, then use
    DeleteRecordingConfiguration.
