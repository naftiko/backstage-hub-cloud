  description: >-
    Deletes all versions of the intent, including the $LATEST version. To delete
    a specific version of the intent, use the DeleteIntentVersion operation. 
    You can delete a version of an intent only if it is not referenced. To
    delete an intent that is referred to in one or more bots (see how-it-works),
    you must remove those references first.    If you get the
    ResourceInUseException exception, it provides an example reference that
    shows where the intent is referenced. To remove the reference to the intent,
    either update the bot or delete it. If you get the same exception when you
    attempt to delete the intent again, repeat until the intent has no
    references and the call to DeleteIntent is successful.    This operation
    requires permission for the lex:DeleteIntent action.
