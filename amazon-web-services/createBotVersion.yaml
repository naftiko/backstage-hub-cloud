  description: >-
    Creates a new version of the bot based on the $LATEST version. If the
    $LATEST version of this resource hasn't changed since you created the last
    version, Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns the last
    created version.  You can update only the $LATEST version of the bot. You
    can't update the numbered versions that you create with the CreateBotVersion
    operation.   When you create the first version of a bot, Amazon Lex sets the
    version to 1. Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see
    versioning-intro.   This operation requires permission for the
    lex:CreateBotVersion action.
