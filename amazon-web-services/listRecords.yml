    Gets paginated records, optionally changed after a particular sync count for
    a dataset and identity. With Amazon Cognito Sync, each identity has access
    only to its own data. Thus, the credentials used to make this API call need
    to have access to the identity data. ListRecords can be called with
    temporary user credentials provided by Cognito Identity or with developer
    credentials. You should use Cognito Identity credentials to make this API
    call.
