  description: >-
    Retrieves the devices available in Amazon Braket.  For backwards
    compatibility with older versions of BraketSchemas, OpenQASM information is
    omitted from GetDevice API calls. To get this information the user-agent
    needs to present a recent version of the BraketSchemas (1.8.0 or later). The
    Braket SDK automatically reports this for you. If you do not see OpenQASM
    results in the GetDevice response when using a Braket SDK, you may need to
    set AWS_EXECUTION_ENV environment variable to configure user-agent. See the
    code examples provided below for how to do this for the AWS CLI, Boto3, and
    the Go, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs.
