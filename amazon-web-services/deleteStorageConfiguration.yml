    Deletes the storage configuration for the specified ARN. If you try to
    delete a storage configuration that is used by a Composition, you will get
    an error (409 ConflictException). To avoid this, for all Compositions that
    reference the storage configuration, first use StopComposition and wait for
    it to complete, then use DeleteStorageConfiguration.
