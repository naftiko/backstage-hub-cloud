    Verifies the specified user attributes in the user pool.  If your user pool
    requires verification before Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value,
    VerifyUserAttribute updates the affected attribute to its pending value. For
    more information, see  UserAttributeUpdateSettingsType.  Authorize this
    action with a signed-in user's access token. It must include the scope
    aws.cognito.signin.user.admin.  Amazon Cognito doesn't evaluate Identity and
    Access Management (IAM) policies in requests for this API operation. For
    this operation, you can't use IAM credentials to authorize requests, and you
    can't grant IAM permissions in policies. For more information about
    authorization models in Amazon Cognito, see Using the Amazon Cognito user
    pools API and user pool endpoints.
