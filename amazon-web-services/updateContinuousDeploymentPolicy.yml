    Updates a continuous deployment policy. You can update a continuous
    deployment policy to enable or disable it, to change the percentage of
    traffic that it sends to the staging distribution, or to change the staging
    distribution that it sends traffic to. When you update a continuous
    deployment policy configuration, all the fields are updated with the values
    that are provided in the request. You cannot update some fields independent
    of others. To update a continuous deployment policy configuration:   Use
    GetContinuousDeploymentPolicyConfig to get the current configuration.  
    Locally modify the fields in the continuous deployment policy configuration
    that you want to update.   Use UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicy, providing
    the entire continuous deployment policy configuration, including the fields
    that you modified and those that you didn't.
