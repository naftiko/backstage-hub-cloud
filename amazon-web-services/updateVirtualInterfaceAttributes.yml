    Updates the specified attributes of the specified virtual private interface.
    Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an
    update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support
    jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all
    virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds. To
    check whether your connection supports jumbo frames, call
    DescribeConnections. To check whether your virtual interface supports jumbo
    frames, call DescribeVirtualInterfaces.
