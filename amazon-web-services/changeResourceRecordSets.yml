    Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains
    authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name.
    For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a resource
    record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has
    an IP address of 192.0.2.44.  Deleting Resource Record Sets  To delete a
    resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified
    when you created it.  Change Batches and Transactional Changes  The request
    body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element.
    The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch.
    Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the
    changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in
    the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely
    affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. 
    For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes
    the CNAME resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias
    resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records
    succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the
    second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either
    the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then the request is canceled, and the
    original CNAME record continues to exist.  If you try to delete the same
    resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53
    returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.   Traffic Flow  To create resource
    record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow
    visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic
    policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic
    policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names
    (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the
    same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates
    if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information,
    see Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer
    Guide.  Create, Delete, and Upsert  Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to
    perform the following actions:    CREATE: Creates a resource record set that
    has the specified values.    DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set
    that has the specified values.    UPSERT: If a resource set doesn't exist,
    Route 53 creates it. If a resource set exists Route 53 updates it with the
    values in the request.     Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting
    Resource Record Sets  The syntax for a request depends on the type of
    resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as
    weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear
    in the order listed in the syntax.  For an example for each type of resource
    record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter
    Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of
    resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using
    ChangeResourceRecordSets.   Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers  When
    you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates your
    changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers managing the hosted
    zone. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of
    PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC.
    Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers managing the hosted
    zone within 60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.  Limits on
    ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests  For information about the limits on a
    ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits in the Amazon Route 53
    Developer Guide.
