    Creates a new version of an existing traffic policy. When you create a new
    version of a traffic policy, you specify the ID of the traffic policy that
    you want to update and a JSON-formatted document that describes the new
    version. You use traffic policies to create multiple DNS resource record
    sets for one domain name (such as example.com) or one subdomain name (such
    as www.example.com). You can create a maximum of 1000 versions of a traffic
    policy. If you reach the limit and need to create another version, you'll
    need to start a new traffic policy.
