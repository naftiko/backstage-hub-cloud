    Updates the status or configuration of a private certificate authority (CA).
    Your private CA must be in the ACTIVE or DISABLED state before you can
    update it. You can disable a private CA that is in the ACTIVE state or make
    a CA that is in the DISABLED state active again.  Both Amazon Web Services
    Private CA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3
    bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have
    permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more
    information, see Access policies for CRLs in Amazon S3.
