    Sets the specified view as the default for the Amazon Web Services Region in
    which you call this operation. When a user performs a Search that doesn't
    explicitly specify which view to use, then Amazon Web Services Resource
    Explorer automatically chooses this default view for searches performed in
    this Amazon Web Services Region. If an Amazon Web Services Region doesn't
    have a default view configured, then users must explicitly specify a view
    with every Search operation performed in that Region.
