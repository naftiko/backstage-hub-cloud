  description: ' Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. This API requires the codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken and sts:GetServiceBearerToken permissions. For more information about authorization tokens, see CodeArtifact authentication and tokens.   CodeArtifact authorization tokens are valid for a period of 12 hours when created with the login command. You can call login periodically to refresh the token. When you create an authorization token with the GetAuthorizationToken API, you can set a custom authorization period, up to a maximum of 12 hours, with the durationSeconds parameter. The authorization period begins after login or GetAuthorizationToken is called. If login or GetAuthorizationToken is called while assuming a role, the token lifetime is independent of the maximum session duration of the role. For example, if you call sts assume-role and specify a session duration of 15 minutes, then generate a CodeArtifact authorization token, the token will be valid for the full authorization period even though this is longer than the 15-minute session duration. See Using IAM Roles for more information on controlling session duration.  '
