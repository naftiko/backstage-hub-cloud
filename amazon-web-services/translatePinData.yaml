    Translates encrypted PIN block from and to ISO 9564 formats 0,1,3,4. For
    more information, see Translate PIN data in the Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography User Guide. PIN block translation involves changing the
    encrytion of PIN block from one encryption key to another encryption key and
    changing PIN block format from one to another without PIN block data leaving
    Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The encryption key transformation
    can be from PEK (Pin Encryption Key) to BDK (Base Derivation Key) for DUKPT
    or from BDK for DUKPT to PEK. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
    supports TDES and AES key derivation type for DUKPT tranlations. You can use
    this operation for P2PE (Point to Point Encryption) use cases where the
    encryption keys should change but the processing system either does not need
    to, or is not permitted to, decrypt the data. The allowed combinations of
    PIN block format translations are guided by PCI. It is important to note
    that not all encrypted PIN block formats (example, format 1) require PAN
    (Primary Account Number) as input. And as such, PIN block format that
    requires PAN (example, formats 0,3,4) cannot be translated to a format
    (format 1) that does not require a PAN for generation.  For information
    about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and
    Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography User Guide.  At this time, Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography does not support translations to PIN format 4.   Cross-account
    use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services
    accounts.  Related operations:     GeneratePinData     VerifyPinData
