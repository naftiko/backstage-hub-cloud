    Posts a batch of documents to a search domain for indexing. A document batch
    is a collection of add and delete operations that represent the documents
    you want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches can be
    described in either JSON or XML. Each item that you want Amazon CloudSearch
    to return as a search result (such as a product) is represented as a
    document. Every document has a unique ID and one or more fields that contain
    the data that you want to search and return in results. Individual documents
    cannot contain more than 1 MB of data. The entire batch cannot exceed 5 MB.
    To get the best possible upload performance, group add and delete operations
    in batches that are close the 5 MB limit. Submitting a large volume of
    single-document batches can overload a domain's document service.  The
    endpoint for submitting UploadDocuments requests is domain-specific. To get
    the document endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch
    configuration service DescribeDomains action. A domain's endpoints are also
    displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.  For
    more information about formatting your data for Amazon CloudSearch, see
    Preparing Your Data in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide. For more
    information about uploading data for indexing, see Uploading Data in the
    Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
