  description: >-
    Uploads position update data for one or more devices to a tracker resource
    (up to 10 devices per batch). Amazon Location uses the data when it reports
    the last known device position and position history. Amazon Location retains
    location data for 30 days.  Position updates are handled based on the
    PositionFiltering property of the tracker. When PositionFiltering is set to
    TimeBased, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections, and
    location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval.
    If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one
    update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID. When
    PositionFiltering is set to DistanceBased filtering, location data is stored
    and evaluated against linked geofence collections only if the device has
    moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft). When PositionFiltering is set to
    AccuracyBased filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against
    linked geofence collections only if the device has moved more than the
    measured accuracy. For example, if two consecutive updates from a device
    have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither
    stored or evaluated if the device has moved less than 15 m. If
    PositionFiltering is set to AccuracyBased filtering, Amazon Location uses
    the default value { "Horizontal": 0} when accuracy is not provided on a
    DevicePositionUpdate.
