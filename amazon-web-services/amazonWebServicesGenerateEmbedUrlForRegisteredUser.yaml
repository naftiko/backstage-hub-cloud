    Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
    experience in your website. This action can be used for any type of user
    registered in an Amazon QuickSight account. Before you use this action, make
    sure that you have configured the relevant Amazon QuickSight resource and
    permissions. The following rules apply to the generated URL:   It contains a
    temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after it is generated.
    Once redeemed within this period, it cannot be re-used again.   The URL
    validity period should not be confused with the actual session lifetime that
    can be customized using the  SessionLifetimeInMinutes  parameter. The
    resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (minimum) to 10 hours
    (maximum). The default session duration is 10 hours.   You are charged only
    when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon QuickSight.   For
    more information, see Embedded Analytics in the Amazon QuickSight User
    Guide. For more information about the high-level steps for embedding and for
    an interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the
