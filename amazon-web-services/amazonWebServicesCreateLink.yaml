    Creates a link between a source account and a sink that you have created in
    a monitoring account. Before you create a link, you must create a sink in
    the monitoring account and create a sink policy in that account. The sink
    policy must permit the source account to link to it. You can grant
    permission to source accounts by granting permission to an entire
    organization or to individual accounts. For more information, see CreateSink
    and PutSinkPolicy. Each monitoring account can be linked to as many as
    100,000 source accounts. Each source account can be linked to as many as
    five monitoring accounts.
