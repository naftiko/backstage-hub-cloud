  description: >-
    Creates a list of environmental variables in an API by its ID value.  When
    creating an environmental variable, it must follow the constraints below:  
    Both JavaScript and VTL templates support environmental variables.  
    Environmental variables are not evaluated before function invocation.  
    Environmental variables only support string values.   Any defined value in
    an environmental variable is considered a string literal and not expanded.  
    Variable evaluations should ideally be performed in the function code.  
    When creating an environmental variable key-value pair, it must follow the
    additional constraints below:   Keys must begin with a letter.   Keys must
    be at least two characters long.   Keys can only contain letters, numbers,
    and the underscore character (_).   Values can be up to 512 characters
    long.   You can configure up to 50 key-value pairs in a GraphQL API.   You
    can create a list of environmental variables by adding it to the
    environmentVariables payload as a list in the format
    {"key1":"value1","key2":"value2", …}. Note that each call of the
    PutGraphqlApiEnvironmentVariables action will result in the overwriting of
    the existing environmental variable list of that API. This means the
    existing environmental variables will be lost. To avoid this, you must
    include all existing and new environmental variables in the list each time
    you call this action.
