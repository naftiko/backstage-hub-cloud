    using a specify traffic policy version.  After you submit a
    CreateTrafficPolicyInstance or an UpdateTrafficPolicyInstance request,
    there's a brief delay while Amazon Route 53 creates the resource record sets
    that are specified in the traffic policy definition. For more information,
    see the State response element.  Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in
    each response. If you have a lot of traffic policy instances, you can use
    the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of up to 100.
