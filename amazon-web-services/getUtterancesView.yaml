    Use the GetUtterancesView operation to get information about the utterances
    that your users have made to your bot. You can use this list to tune the
    utterances that your bot responds to. For example, say that you have created
    a bot to order flowers. After your users have used your bot for a while, use
    the GetUtterancesView operation to see the requests that they have made and
    whether they have been successful. You might find that the utterance "I want
    flowers" is not being recognized. You could add this utterance to the
    OrderFlowers intent so that your bot recognizes that utterance. After you
    publish a new version of a bot, you can get information about the old
    version and the new so that you can compare the performance across the two
    versions.  Utterance statistics are generated once a day. Data is available
    for the last 15 days. You can request information for up to 5 versions of
    your bot in each request. Amazon Lex returns the most frequent utterances
    received by the bot in the last 15 days. The response contains information
    about a maximum of 100 utterances for each version. If you set childDirected
    field to true when you created your bot, if you are using slot obfuscation
    with one or more slots, or if you opted out of participating in improving
    Amazon Lex, utterances are not available. This operation requires
    permissions for the lex:GetUtterancesView action.
