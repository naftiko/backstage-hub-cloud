    Sets the supplied tag-set on an S3 Batch Operations job. A tag is a
    key-value pair. You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any job by
    sending a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated
    with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace the
    existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag set by
    retrieving the existing tag set using GetJobTagging, modify that tag set,
    and use this operation to replace the tag set with the one you modified. For
    more information, see Controlling access and labeling jobs using tags in the
    Amazon S3 User Guide.     If you send this request with an empty tag set,
    Amazon S3 deletes the existing tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you
    use this method, you are charged for a Tier 1 Request (PUT). For more
    information, see Amazon S3 pricing.   For deleting existing tags for your
    Batch Operations job, a DeleteJobTagging request is preferred because it
    achieves the same result without incurring charges.   A few things to
    consider about using tags:   Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to
    50 tags per job.   You can associate up to 50 tags with a job as long as
    they have unique tag keys.   A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters
    in length, and tag values can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.  
    The key and values are case sensitive.   For tagging-related restrictions
    related to characters and encodings, see User-Defined Tag Restrictions in
    the Billing and Cost Management User Guide.       Permissions  To use the
    PutJobTagging operation, you must have permission to perform the
    s3:PutJobTagging action.   Related actions include:    CreateJob
