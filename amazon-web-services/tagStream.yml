    Adds one or more tags to a stream. A tag is a key-value pair (the value is
    optional) that you can define and assign to Amazon Web Services resources.
    If you specify a tag that already exists, the tag value is replaced with the
    value that you specify in the request. For more information, see Using Cost
    Allocation Tags in the Billing and Cost Management and Cost Management User
    Guide.  You must provide either the StreamName or the StreamARN. This
    operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:TagStream action. A
