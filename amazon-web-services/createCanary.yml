    Creates a canary. Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs
    from the outside-in. Canaries help you check the availability and latency of
    your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time
    data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to
    run continuously or just once.  Do not use CreateCanary to modify an
    existing canary. Use UpdateCanary instead. To create canaries, you must have
    the CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess policy. If you are creating a new IAM
    role for the canary, you also need the iam:CreateRole, iam:CreatePolicy and
    iam:AttachRolePolicy permissions. For more information, see Necessary Roles
    and Permissions. Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your
    canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name
    (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the
    internet. For more information, see Security Considerations for Synthetics
    Canaries.
