    Resets metadata about your connector entities that Amazon AppFlow stored in
    its cache. Use this action when you want Amazon AppFlow to return the latest
    information about the data that you have in a source application. Amazon
    AppFlow returns metadata about your entities when you use the
    ListConnectorEntities or DescribeConnectorEntities actions. Following these
    actions, Amazon AppFlow caches the metadata to reduce the number of API
    requests that it must send to the source application. Amazon AppFlow
    automatically resets the cache once every hour, but you can use this action
    when you want to get the latest metadata right away.
