    Sends a command to an Amazon QLDB ledger.  Instead of interacting directly
    with this API, we recommend using the QLDB driver or the QLDB shell to
    execute data transactions on a ledger.   If you are working with an AWS SDK,
    use the QLDB driver. The driver provides a high-level abstraction layer
    above this QLDB Session data plane and manages SendCommand API calls for
    you. For information and a list of supported programming languages, see
    Getting started with the driver in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.   If you
    are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), use the QLDB
    shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses the QLDB driver to
    interact with a ledger. For information, see Accessing Amazon QLDB using the
    QLDB shell.
