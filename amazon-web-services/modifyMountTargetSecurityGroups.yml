  description: >-
    Modifies the set of security groups in effect for a mount target. When you
    create a mount target, Amazon EFS also creates a new network interface. For
    more information, see CreateMountTarget. This operation replaces the
    security groups in effect for the network interface associated with a mount
    target, with the SecurityGroups provided in the request. This operation
    requires that the network interface of the mount target has been created and
    the lifecycle state of the mount target is not deleted.  The operation
    requires permissions for the following actions:   
    elasticfilesystem:ModifyMountTargetSecurityGroups action on the mount
    target's file system.     ec2:ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute action on the
    mount target's network interface.
