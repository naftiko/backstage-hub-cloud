    Creates a new version of the specified customer managed permission. The new
    version is automatically set as the default version of the customer managed
    permission. New resource shares automatically use the default permission.
    Existing resource shares continue to use their original permission versions,
    but you can use ReplacePermissionAssociations to update them. If the
    specified customer managed permission already has the maximum of 5 versions,
    then you must delete one of the existing versions before you can create a
    new one.
