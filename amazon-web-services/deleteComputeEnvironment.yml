  description: >-
    Deletes an Batch compute environment. Before you can delete a compute
    environment, you must set its state to DISABLED with the
    UpdateComputeEnvironment API operation and disassociate it from any job
    queues with the UpdateJobQueue API operation. Compute environments that use
    Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment
    before deleting the compute environment. If this isn't done, the compute
    environment enters an invalid state.
