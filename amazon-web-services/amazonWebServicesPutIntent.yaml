  description: >-
    Creates an intent or replaces an existing intent. To define the interaction
    between the user and your bot, you use one or more intents. For a pizza
    ordering bot, for example, you would create an OrderPizza intent.  To create
    an intent or replace an existing intent, you must provide the following:  
    Intent name. For example, OrderPizza.   Sample utterances. For example, "Can
    I order a pizza, please." and "I want to order a pizza."   Information to be
    gathered. You specify slot types for the information that your bot will
    request from the user. You can specify standard slot types, such as a date
    or a time, or custom slot types such as the size and crust of a pizza.   How
    the intent will be fulfilled. You can provide a Lambda function or configure
    the intent to return the intent information to the client application. If
    you use a Lambda function, when all of the intent information is available,
    Amazon Lex invokes your Lambda function. If you configure your intent to
    return the intent information to the client application.    You can specify
    other optional information in the request, such as:   A confirmation prompt
    to ask the user to confirm an intent. For example, "Shall I order your
    pizza?"   A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent has
    been fulfilled. For example, "I placed your pizza order."   A follow-up
    prompt that asks the user for additional activity. For example, asking "Do
    you want to order a drink with your pizza?"   If you specify an existing
    intent name to update the intent, Amazon Lex replaces the values in the
    $LATEST version of the intent with the values in the request. Amazon Lex
    removes fields that you don't provide in the request. If you don't specify
    the required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception. When you update the
    $LATEST version of an intent, the status field of any bot that uses the
    $LATEST version of the intent is set to NOT_BUILT. For more information, see
    how-it-works. This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutIntent
    action.
