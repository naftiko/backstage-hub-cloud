    Updates the configuration for a CloudFront distribution. The update process
    includes getting the current distribution configuration, updating it to make
    your changes, and then submitting an UpdateDistribution request to make the
    updates.  To update a web distribution using the CloudFront API    Use
    GetDistributionConfig to get the current configuration, including the
    version identifier (ETag).   Update the distribution configuration that was
    returned in the response. Note the following important requirements and
    restrictions:   You must rename the ETag field to IfMatch, leaving the value
    unchanged. (Set the value of IfMatch to the value of ETag, then remove the
    ETag field.)   You can't change the value of CallerReference.     Submit an
    UpdateDistribution request, providing the distribution configuration. The
    new configuration replaces the existing configuration. The values that you
    specify in an UpdateDistribution request are not merged into your existing
    configuration. Make sure to include all fields: the ones that you modified
    and also the ones that you didn't.
