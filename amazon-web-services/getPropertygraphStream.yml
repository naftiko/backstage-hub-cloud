    Gets a stream for a property graph. With the Neptune Streams feature, you
    can generate a complete sequence of change-log entries that record every
    change made to your graph data as it happens. GetPropertygraphStream lets
    you collect these change-log entries for a property graph. The Neptune
    streams feature needs to be enabled on your Neptune DBcluster. To enable
    streams, set the neptune_streams DB cluster parameter to 1. See Capturing
    graph changes in real time using Neptune streams. When invoking this
    operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM
    user or role making the request must have a policy attached that allows the
    neptune-db:GetStreamRecords IAM action in that cluster. When invoking this
    operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM
    user or role making the request must have a policy attached that enables one
    of the following IAM actions, depending on the query: Note that you can
    restrict property-graph queries using the following IAM context keys:   
    neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin     neptune-db:QueryLanguage:OpenCypher   
    See Condition keys available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
