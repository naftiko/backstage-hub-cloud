    Gets media for a list of fragments (specified by fragment number) from the
    archived data in an Amazon Kinesis video stream.  You must first call the
    GetDataEndpoint API to get an endpoint. Then send the
    GetMediaForFragmentList requests to this endpoint using the --endpoint-url
    parameter.   For limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits.  If an error is
    thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams archived media API, in
    addition to the HTTP status code and the response body, it includes the
    following pieces of information:     x-amz-ErrorType HTTP header – contains
    a more specific error type in addition to what the HTTP status code
    provides.     x-amz-RequestId HTTP header – if you want to report an issue
    to Amazon Web Services, the support team can better diagnose the problem if
    given the Request Id.   Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header
    can be utilized to make programmatic decisions about whether errors are
    retry-able and under what conditions, as well as provide information on what
    actions the client programmer might need to take in order to successfully
    try again. For more information, see the Errors section at the bottom of
    this topic, as well as Common Errors.
