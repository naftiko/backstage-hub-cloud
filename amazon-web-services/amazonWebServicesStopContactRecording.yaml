    Stops recording a call when a contact is being recorded.
    StopContactRecording is a one-time action. If you use StopContactRecording
    to stop recording an ongoing call, you can't use StartContactRecording to
    restart it. For scenarios where the recording has started and you want to
    suspend it for sensitive information (for example, to collect a credit card
    number), and then restart it, use SuspendContactRecording and
    ResumeContactRecording. Only voice recordings are supported at this time.
