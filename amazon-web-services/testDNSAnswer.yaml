    Gets the value that Amazon Route 53 returns in response to a DNS request for
    a specified record name and type. You can optionally specify the IP address
    of a DNS resolver, an EDNS0 client subnet IP address, and a subnet mask. 
    This call only supports querying public hosted zones.  The TestDnsAnswer 
    returns information similar to what you would expect from the answer section
    of the dig command. Therefore, if you query for the name servers of a
    subdomain that point to the parent name servers, those will not be
    returned.
