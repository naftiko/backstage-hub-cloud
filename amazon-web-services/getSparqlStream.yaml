    Gets a stream for an RDF graph. With the Neptune Streams feature, you can
    generate a complete sequence of change-log entries that record every change
    made to your graph data as it happens. GetSparqlStream lets you collect
    these change-log entries for an RDF graph. The Neptune streams feature needs
    to be enabled on your Neptune DBcluster. To enable streams, set the
    neptune_streams DB cluster parameter to 1. See Capturing graph changes in
    real time using Neptune streams. When invoking this operation in a Neptune
    cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the
    request must have a policy attached that allows the
    neptune-db:GetStreamRecords IAM action in that cluster. Note that the
    neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Sparql IAM condition key can be used in the policy
    document to restrict the use of SPARQL queries (see Condition keys available
    in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
