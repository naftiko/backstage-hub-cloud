    When you disable Amazon Security Lake from your account, Security Lake is
    disabled in all Amazon Web Services Regions and it stops collecting data
    from your sources. Also, this API automatically takes steps to remove the
    account from Security Lake. However, Security Lake retains all of your
    existing settings and the resources that it created in your Amazon Web
    Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region. The
    DeleteDataLake operation does not delete the data that is stored in your
    Amazon S3 bucket, which is owned by your Amazon Web Services account. For
    more information, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide.
