    Creates a resiliency policy for an application.  Resilience Hub allows you
    to provide a value of zero for rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs of your resiliency
    policy. But, while assessing your application, the lowest possible
    assessment result is near zero. Hence, if you provide value zero for
    rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs, the estimated workload RTO and estimated workload
    RPO result will be near zero and the Compliance status for your application
    will be set to Policy breached.
