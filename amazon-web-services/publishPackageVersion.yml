    Creates a new package version containing one or more assets (or files). The
    unfinished flag can be used to keep the package version in the Unfinished
    state until all of its assets have been uploaded (see Package version status
    in the CodeArtifact user guide). To set the package version’s status to
    Published, omit the unfinished flag when uploading the final asset, or set
    the status using UpdatePackageVersionStatus. Once a package version’s status
    is set to Published, it cannot change back to Unfinished.  Only generic
    packages can be published using this API. For more information, see Using
    generic packages in the CodeArtifact User Guide.
