    Writes a block of data to a snapshot. If the specified block contains data,
    the existing data is overwritten. The target snapshot must be in the pending
    state. Data written to a snapshot must be aligned with 512-KiB sectors.  You
    should always retry requests that receive server (5xx) error responses, and
    ThrottlingException and RequestThrottledException client error responses.
