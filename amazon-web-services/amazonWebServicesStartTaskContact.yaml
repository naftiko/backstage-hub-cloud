    Initiates a flow to start a new task contact. For more information about
    task contacts, see Concepts: Tasks in Amazon Connect in the Amazon Connect
    Administrator Guide.  When using PreviousContactId and RelatedContactId
    input parameters, note the following:    PreviousContactId    Any updates to
    user-defined task contact attributes on any contact linked through the same
    PreviousContactId will affect every contact in the chain.   There can be a
    maximum of 12 linked task contacts in a chain. That is, 12 task contacts can
    be created that share the same PreviousContactId.      RelatedContactId   
    Copies contact attributes from the related task contact to the new
    contact.   Any update on attributes in a new task contact does not update
    attributes on previous contact.   There’s no limit on the number of task
    contacts that can be created that use the same RelatedContactId.     In
    addition, when calling StartTaskContact include only one of these
    parameters: ContactFlowID, QuickConnectID, or TaskTemplateID. Only one
    parameter is required as long as the task template has a flow configured to
    run it. If more than one parameter is specified, or only the TaskTemplateID
    is specified but it does not have a flow configured, the request returns an
    error because Amazon Connect cannot identify the unique flow to run when the
    task is created. A ServiceQuotaExceededException occurs when the number of
    open tasks exceeds the active tasks quota or there are already 12 tasks
    referencing the same PreviousContactId. For more information about service
    quotas for task contacts, see Amazon Connect service quotas in the Amazon
    Connect Administrator Guide.
