  description: >-
    Updates a composite model and all of the assets that were created from the
    model. Each asset created from the model inherits the updated asset model's
    property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see Updating
    assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide.  If you remove a property
    from a composite asset model, IoT SiteWise deletes all previous data for
    that property. You can’t change the type or data type of an existing
    property. To replace an existing composite asset model property with a new
    one with the same name, do the following:   Submit an
    UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel request with the entire existing property
    removed.   Submit a second UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel request that
    includes the new property. The new asset property will have the same name as
    the previous one and IoT SiteWise will generate a new unique id.
