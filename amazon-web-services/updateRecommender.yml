    Updates the recommender to modify the recommender configuration. If you
    update the recommender to modify the columns used in training, Amazon
    Personalize automatically starts a full retraining of the models backing
    your recommender. While the update completes, you can still get
    recommendations from the recommender. The recommender uses the previous
    configuration until the update completes. To track the status of this
    update, use the latestRecommenderUpdate returned in the DescribeRecommender
    operation.
