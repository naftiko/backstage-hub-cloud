    Updates the specified policy template. You can update only the description
    and the some elements of the policyBody.   Changes you make to the policy
    template content are immediately (within the constraints of eventual
    consistency) reflected in authorization decisions that involve all
    template-linked policies instantiated from this template.   Verified
    Permissions is  eventually consistent . It can take a few seconds for a new
    or changed element to be propagate through the service and be visible in the
    results of other Verified Permissions operations.
