    Creates a resource share. You can provide a list of the Amazon Resource
    Names (ARNs) for the resources that you want to share, a list of principals
    you want to share the resources with, and the permissions to grant those
    principals.  Sharing a resource makes it available for use by principals
    outside of the Amazon Web Services account that created the resource.
