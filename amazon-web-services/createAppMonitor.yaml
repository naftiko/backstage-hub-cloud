  description: >-
    Creates a Amazon CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which collects telemetry data
    from your application and sends that data to RUM. The data includes
    performance and reliability information such as page load time, client-side
    errors, and user behavior. You use this operation only to create a new app
    monitor. To update an existing app monitor, use UpdateAppMonitor instead.
    After you create an app monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM console to
    get the JavaScript code snippet to add to your web application. For more
    information, see How do I find a code snippet that I've already generated?
