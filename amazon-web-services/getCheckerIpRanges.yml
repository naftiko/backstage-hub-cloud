    Route 53 does not perform authorization for this API because it retrieves
    information that is already available to the public.   GetCheckerIpRanges
    still works, but we recommend that you download ip-ranges.json, which
    includes IP address ranges for all Amazon Web Services services. For more
    information, see IP Address Ranges of Amazon Route 53 Servers in the Amazon
    Route 53 Developer Guide.
