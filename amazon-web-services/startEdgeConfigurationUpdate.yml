  description: >-
    An asynchronous API that updates a stream’s existing edge configuration. The
    Kinesis Video Stream will sync the stream’s edge configuration with the Edge
    Agent IoT Greengrass component that runs on an IoT Hub Device, setup at your
    premise. The time to sync can vary and depends on the connectivity of the
    Hub Device. The SyncStatus will be updated as the edge configuration is
    acknowledged, and synced with the Edge Agent.  If this API is invoked for
    the first time, a new edge configuration will be created for the stream, and
    the sync status will be set to SYNCING. You will have to wait for the sync
    status to reach a terminal state such as: IN_SYNC, or SYNC_FAILED, before
    using this API again. If you invoke this API during the syncing process, a
    ResourceInUseException will be thrown. The connectivity of the stream’s edge
    configuration and the Edge Agent will be retried for 15 minutes. After 15
    minutes, the status will transition into the SYNC_FAILED state. To move an
    edge configuration from one device to another, use DeleteEdgeConfiguration
    to delete the current edge configuration. You can then invoke
    StartEdgeConfigurationUpdate with an updated Hub Device ARN.
