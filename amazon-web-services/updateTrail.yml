    Updates trail settings that control what events you are logging, and how to
    handle log files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the CloudTrail
    service. Use this action to designate an existing bucket for log delivery.
    If the existing bucket has previously been a target for CloudTrail log
    files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket. UpdateTrail must be called from
    the Region in which the trail was created; otherwise, an
    InvalidHomeRegionException is thrown.
