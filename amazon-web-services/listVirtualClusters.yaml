    Lists information about the specified virtual cluster. Virtual cluster is a
    managed entity on Amazon EMR on EKS. You can create, describe, list and
    delete virtual clusters. They do not consume any additional resource in your

    Given this relationship, you can model virtual clusters the same way you
    model Kubernetes namespaces to meet your requirements.
