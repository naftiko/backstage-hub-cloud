    Updates all resource shares that use a managed permission to a different
    managed permission. This operation always applies the default version of the
    target managed permission. You can optionally specify that the update
    applies to only resource shares that currently use a specified version. This
    enables you to update to the latest version, without changing the which
    managed permission is used. You can use this operation to update all of your
    resource shares to use the current default version of the permission by
    specifying the same value for the fromPermissionArn and toPermissionArn
    parameters. You can use the optional fromPermissionVersion parameter to
    update only those resources that use a specified version of the managed
    permission to the new managed permission.  To successfully perform this
    operation, you must have permission to update the resource-based policy on
    all affected resource types.
