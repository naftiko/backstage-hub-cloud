  description: ' Calculates a route given the following required parameters: DeparturePosition and DestinationPosition. Requires that you first create a route calculator resource. By default, a request that doesn''t specify a departure time uses the best time of day to travel with the best traffic conditions when calculating the route. Additional options include:    Specifying a departure time using either DepartureTime or DepartNow. This calculates a route based on predictive traffic data at the given time.   You can''t specify both DepartureTime and DepartNow in a single request. Specifying both parameters returns a validation error.     Specifying a travel mode using TravelMode sets the transportation mode used to calculate the routes. This also lets you specify additional route preferences in CarModeOptions if traveling by Car, or TruckModeOptions if traveling by Truck.  If you specify walking for the travel mode and your data provider is Esri, the start and destination must be within 40km.   '
