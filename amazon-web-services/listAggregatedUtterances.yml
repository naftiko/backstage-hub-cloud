metadata:
  name: Listaggregatedutterances
  description: >-
    Provides a list of utterances that users have sent to the bot. Utterances
    are aggregated by the text of the utterance. For example, all instances
    where customers used the phrase "I want to order pizza" are aggregated into
    the same line in the response. You can see both detected utterances and
    missed utterances. A detected utterance is where the bot properly recognized
    the utterance and activated the associated intent. A missed utterance was
    not recognized by the bot and didn't activate an intent. Utterances can be
    aggregated for a bot alias or for a bot version, but not both at the same
    time. Utterances statistics are not generated under the following
    conditions:   The childDirected field was set to true when the bot was
    created.   You are using slot obfuscation with one or more slots.   You
    opted out of participating in improving Amazon Lex.
