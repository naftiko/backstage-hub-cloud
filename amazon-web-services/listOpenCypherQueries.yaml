    Lists active openCypher queries. See Neptune openCypher status endpoint for
    more information. When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has
    IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must
    have a policy attached that allows the neptune-db:GetQueryStatus IAM action
    in that cluster. Note that the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:OpenCypher IAM
    condition key can be used in the policy document to restrict the use of
    openCypher queries (see Condition keys available in Neptune IAM data-access
    policy statements).
