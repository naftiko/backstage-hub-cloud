    Creates an Resilience Hub application. An Resilience Hub application is a
    collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to prevent and
    recover Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To describe a
    Resilience Hub application, you provide an application name, resources from
    one or more CloudFormation stacks, Resource Groups, Terraform state files,
    AppRegistry applications, and an appropriate resiliency policy. In addition,
    you can also add resources that are located on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
    Service (Amazon EKS) clusters as optional resources. For more information
    about the number of resources supported per application, see Service quotas.
    After you create an Resilience Hub application, you publish it so that you
    can run a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use recommendations from
    the assessment to improve resiliency by running another assessment,
    comparing results, and then iterating the process until you achieve your
    goals for recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).
