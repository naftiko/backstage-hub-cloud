    Evaluates the given code and returns the response. The code definition
    requirements depend on the specified runtime. For APPSYNC_JS runtimes, the
    code defines the request and response functions. The request function takes
    the incoming request after a GraphQL operation is parsed and converts it
    into a request configuration for the selected data source operation. The
    response function interprets responses from the data source and maps it to
    the shape of the GraphQL field output type.
