    Generates a Message Authentication Code (MAC) cryptogram within Amazon Web
    Services Payment Cryptography.  You can use this operation when keys won't
    be shared but mutual data is present on both ends for validation. In this
    case, known data values are used to generate a MAC on both ends for
    comparision without sending or receiving data in ciphertext or plaintext.
    You can use this operation to generate a DUPKT, HMAC or EMV MAC by setting
    generation attributes and algorithm to the associated values. The MAC
    generation encryption key must have valid values for KeyUsage such as
    TR31_M7_HMAC_KEY for HMAC generation, and they key must have KeyModesOfUse
    set to Generate and Verify. For information about valid keys for this
    operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data
    operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.  
    Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web
    Services accounts.  Related operations:     VerifyMac
