    Claims an available phone number to your Amazon Connect instance or traffic
    distribution group. You can call this API only in the same Amazon Web
    Services Region where the Amazon Connect instance or traffic distribution
    group was created. For more information about how to use this operation, see
    Claim a phone number in your country and Claim phone numbers to traffic
    distribution groups in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.   You can
    call the SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers API for available phone numbers that
    you can claim. Call the DescribePhoneNumber API to verify the status of a
    previous ClaimPhoneNumber operation.  If you plan to claim and release
    numbers frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota
    exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming and
    releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released has
    expired. By default you can claim and release up to 200% of your maximum
    number of active phone numbers during any 30 day period. If you claim and
    release phone numbers using the UI or API during a rolling 30 day cycle that
    exceeds 200% of your phone number service level quota, you will be blocked
    from claiming any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number released
    has expired.  For example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a
    service level quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you
    release 99, claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200%
    limit. At that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until
    you open an Amazon Web Services support ticket.
