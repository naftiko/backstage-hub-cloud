    For a specific governed table, provides a list of Amazon S3 objects that
    will be written during the current transaction and that can be automatically
    deleted if the transaction is canceled. Without this call, no Amazon S3
    objects are automatically deleted when a transaction cancels.   The Glue ETL
    library function write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog() includes an option to
    automatically call DeleteObjectsOnCancel before writes. For more
    information, see Rolling Back Amazon S3 Writes.
