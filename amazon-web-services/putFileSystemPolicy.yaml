    Applies an Amazon EFS FileSystemPolicy to an Amazon EFS file system. A file
    system policy is an IAM resource-based policy and can contain multiple
    policy statements. A file system always has exactly one file system policy,
    which can be the default policy or an explicit policy set or updated using
    this API operation. EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit.
    When an explicit policy is set, it overrides the default policy. For more
    information about the default file system policy, see Default EFS File
    System Policy.   EFS file system policies have a 20,000 character limit. 
    This operation requires permissions for the
    elasticfilesystem:PutFileSystemPolicy action.
