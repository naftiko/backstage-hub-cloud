  description: >-
    Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to establish
    an individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the token is used to
    connect to chat, the connection is valid for the session duration specified
    in the request. The token becomes invalid at the token-expiration timestamp
    included in the response. Use the capabilities field to permit an end user
    to send messages or moderate a room. The attributes field securely attaches
    structured data to the chat session; the data is included within each
    message sent by the end user and received by other participants in the room.
    Common use cases for attributes include passing end-user profile data like
    an icon, display name, colors, badges, and other display features.
    Encryption keys are owned by Amazon IVS Chat and never used directly by your
    application.
