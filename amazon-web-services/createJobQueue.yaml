    Creates an Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one
    or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference
    for the compute environments. You also set a priority to the job queue that
    determines the order that the Batch scheduler places jobs onto its
    associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is
    associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher
    priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute
    environment.
