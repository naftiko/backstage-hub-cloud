  description: >-
    Detects anomalies in an image that you supply.  The response from
    DetectAnomalies includes a boolean prediction that the image contains one or
    more anomalies and a confidence value for the prediction. If the model is an
    image segmentation model, the response also includes segmentation
    information for each type of anomaly found in the image.  Before calling
    DetectAnomalies, you must first start your model with the StartModel
    operation. You are charged for the amount of time, in minutes, that a model
    runs and for the number of anomaly detection units that your model uses. If
    you are not using a model, use the StopModel operation to stop your model.  
    For more information, see Detecting anomalies in an image in the Amazon
    Lookout for Vision developer guide. This operation requires permissions to
    perform the lookoutvision:DetectAnomalies operation.
