    Updates an image pipeline. Image pipelines enable you to automate the
    creation and distribution of images. You must specify exactly one recipe for
    your image, using either a containerRecipeArn or an imageRecipeArn. 
    UpdateImagePipeline does not support selective updates for the pipeline. You
    must specify all of the required properties in the update request, not just
    the properties that have changed.
