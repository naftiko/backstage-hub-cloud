    Updates routing priority and age on the contact (QueuePriority and
    QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds). These properties can be used to change a
    customer's position in the queue. For example, you can move a contact to the
    back of the queue by setting a lower routing priority relative to other
    contacts in queue; or you can move a contact to the front of the queue by
    increasing the routing age which will make the contact look artificially
    older and therefore higher up in the first-in-first-out routing order. Note
    that adjusting the routing age of a contact affects only its position in
    queue, and not its actual queue wait time as reported through metrics. These
    properties can also be updated by using the Set routing priority / age flow
    block.
