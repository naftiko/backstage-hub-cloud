    Adds a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security Lake
    source. Enables source types for member accounts in required Amazon Web
    Services Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can choose any
    source type in any Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted
    organization or standalone accounts. Once you add an Amazon Web Service as a
    source, Security Lake starts collecting logs and events from it. You can use
    this API only to enable natively supported Amazon Web Services as a source.
    Use CreateCustomLogSource to enable data collection from a custom source.
