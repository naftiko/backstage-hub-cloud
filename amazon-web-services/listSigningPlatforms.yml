    Lists all signing platforms available in AWS Signer that match the request
    parameters. If additional jobs remain to be listed, Signer returns a
    nextToken value. Use this value in subsequent calls to ListSigningJobs to
    fetch the remaining values. You can continue calling ListSigningJobs with
    your maxResults parameter and with new values that Signer returns in the
    nextToken parameter until all of your signing jobs have been returned.
