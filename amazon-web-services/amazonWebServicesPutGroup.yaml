    Create, or updates, a mapping of users—who have access to a document—to
    groups. You can also map sub groups to groups. For example, the group
    "Company Intellectual Property Teams" includes sub groups "Research" and
    "Engineering". These sub groups include their own list of users or people
    who work in these teams. Only users who work in research and engineering,
    and therefore belong in the intellectual property group, can see top-secret
    company documents in their Amazon Q chat results.
