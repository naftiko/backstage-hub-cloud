    The PutRecord API is used to ingest a list of Records into your feature
    group.  If a new record’s EventTime is greater, the new record is written to
    both the OnlineStore and OfflineStore. Otherwise, the record is a historic
    record and it is written only to the OfflineStore.  You can specify the
    ingestion to be applied to the OnlineStore, OfflineStore, or both by using
    the TargetStores request parameter.  You can set the ingested record to
    expire at a given time to live (TTL) duration after the record’s event time,
    ExpiresAt = EventTime + TtlDuration, by specifying the TtlDuration
    parameter. A record level TtlDuration is set when specifying the TtlDuration
    parameter using the PutRecord API call. If the input TtlDuration is null or
    unspecified, TtlDuration is set to the default feature group level
    TtlDuration. A record level TtlDuration supersedes the group level
    TtlDuration.
