    This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to change.
    Associates a storage resource type for the first time. You can only
    associate one type of storage configuration in a single call. This means,
    for example, that you can't define an instance with multiple S3 buckets for
    storing chat transcripts. This API does not create a resource that doesn't
    exist. It only associates it to the instance. Ensure that the resource being
    specified in the storage configuration, like an S3 bucket, exists when being
    used for association.
