  description: >-
    Downloads an MP4 file (clip) containing the archived, on-demand media from
    the specified video stream over the specified time range.  Both the
    StreamName and the StreamARN parameters are optional, but you must specify
    either the StreamName or the StreamARN when invoking this API operation.  As
    a prerequisite to using GetCLip API, you must obtain an endpoint using
    GetDataEndpoint, specifying GET_CLIP for the APIName parameter.  An Amazon
    Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for providing data
    through MP4:   The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and,
    optionally, AAC or G.711 encoded audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track
    1 should be V_MPEG/ISO/AVC (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for H.265).
    Optionally, the codec ID of track 2 should be A_AAC (for AAC) or A_MS/ACM
    (for G.711).   Data retention must be greater than 0.   The video track of
    each fragment must contain codec private data in the Advanced Video Coding
    (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265 format. For more information, see
    MPEG-4 specification ISO/IEC 14496-15. For information about adapting stream
    data to a given format, see NAL Adaptation Flags.   The audio track (if
    present) of each fragment must contain codec private data in the AAC format
    (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7) or the MS Wave format.   You can monitor
    the amount of outgoing data by monitoring the GetClip.OutgoingBytes Amazon
    CloudWatch metric. For information about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis
    Video Streams, see Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams. For pricing
    information, see Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Pricing and  Amazon Web
    Services Pricing. Charges for outgoing Amazon Web Services data apply.
