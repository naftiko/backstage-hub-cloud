    This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a
    key and a value. Each vault can have up to 10 tags. If your request would
    cause the tag limit for the vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the
    LimitExceededException error. If a tag already exists on the vault under a
    specified key, the existing key value will be overwritten. For more
    information about tags, see Tagging Amazon S3 Glacier Resources.
