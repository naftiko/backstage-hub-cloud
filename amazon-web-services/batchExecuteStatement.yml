    Runs a batch SQL statement over an array of data. You can run bulk update
    and insert operations for multiple records using a DML statement with
    different parameter sets. Bulk operations can provide a significant
    performance improvement over individual insert and update operations.  If a
    call isn't part of a transaction because it doesn't include the
    transactionID parameter, changes that result from the call are committed
    automatically. There isn't a fixed upper limit on the number of parameter
    sets. However, the maximum size of the HTTP request submitted through the
    Data API is 4 MiB. If the request exceeds this limit, the Data API returns
    an error and doesn't process the request. This 4-MiB limit includes the size
    of the HTTP headers and the JSON notation in the request. Thus, the number
    of parameter sets that you can include depends on a combination of factors,
    such as the size of the SQL statement and the size of each parameter set.
    The response size limit is 1 MiB. If the call returns more than 1 MiB of
    response data, the call is terminated.
