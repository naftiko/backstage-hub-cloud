    Seals and completes the snapshot after all of the required blocks of data
    have been written to it. Completing the snapshot changes the status to
    completed. You cannot write new blocks to a snapshot after it has been
    completed.  You should always retry requests that receive server (5xx) error
    responses, and ThrottlingException and RequestThrottledException client
    error responses. For more information see Error retries in the Amazon
