metadata:
  name: Getchannelmessagestatus
  description: >-
    Gets message status for a specified messageId. Use this API to determine the
    intermediate status of messages going through channel flow processing. The
    API provides an alternative to retrieving message status if the event was
    not received because a client wasn't connected to a websocket.  Messages can
    have any one of these statuses.  SENT  Message processed successfully 
    PENDING  Ongoing processing  FAILED  Processing failed  DENIED  Message
    denied by the processor      This API does not return statuses for denied
    messages, because we don't store them once the processor denies them.   
    Only the message sender can invoke this API.   The x-amz-chime-bearer
    request header is mandatory. Use the ARN of the AppInstanceUser or
    AppInstanceBot that makes the API call as the value in the header.
