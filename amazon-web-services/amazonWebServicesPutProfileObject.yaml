  description: >-
    Adds additional objects to customer profiles of a given ObjectType. When
    adding a specific profile object, like a Contact Record, an inferred profile
    can get created if it is not mapped to an existing profile. The resulting
    profile will only have a phone number populated in the standard
    ProfileObject. Any additional Contact Records with the same phone number
    will be mapped to the same inferred profile. When a ProfileObject is created
    and if a ProfileObjectType already exists for the ProfileObject, it will
    provide data to a standard profile depending on the ProfileObjectType
    definition. PutProfileObject needs an ObjectType, which can be created using
    PutProfileObjectType.
