    Creates a traffic distribution group given an Amazon Connect instance that
    has been replicated.   The SignInConfig distribution is available only on a
    default TrafficDistributionGroup (see the IsDefault parameter in the
    TrafficDistributionGroup data type). If you call UpdateTrafficDistribution
    with a modified SignInConfig and a non-default TrafficDistributionGroup, an
    InvalidRequestException is returned.  For more information about creating
    traffic distribution groups, see Set up traffic distribution groups in the
    Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.
