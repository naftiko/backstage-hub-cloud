    Updates a resiliency policy.  Resilience Hub allows you to provide a value
    of zero for rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs of your resiliency policy. But, while
    assessing your application, the lowest possible assessment result is near
    zero. Hence, if you provide value zero for rtoInSecs and rpoInSecs, the
    estimated workload RTO and estimated workload RPO result will be near zero
    and the Compliance status for your application will be set to Policy
    breached.
