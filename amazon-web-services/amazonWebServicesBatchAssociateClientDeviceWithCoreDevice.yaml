  description: >-
    Associates a list of client devices with a core device. Use this API
    operation to specify which client devices can discover a core device through
    cloud discovery. With cloud discovery, client devices connect to IoT
    Greengrass to retrieve associated core devices' connectivity information and
    certificates. For more information, see Configure cloud discovery in the IoT
    Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.  Client devices are local IoT devices that
    connect to and communicate with an IoT Greengrass core device over MQTT. You
    can connect client devices to a core device to sync MQTT messages and data
    to Amazon Web Services IoT Core and interact with client devices in
    Greengrass components. For more information, see Interact with local IoT
    devices in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide.
