    The TestRole operation tests the IAM role used to create the pipeline. The
    TestRole action lets you determine whether the IAM role you are using has
    sufficient permissions to let Elastic Transcoder perform tasks associated
    with the transcoding process. The action attempts to assume the specified
    IAM role, checks read access to the input and output buckets, and tries to
    send a test notification to Amazon SNS topics that you specify.
