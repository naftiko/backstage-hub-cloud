  description: >-
    Deletes all versions of the slot type, including the $LATEST version. To
    delete a specific version of the slot type, use the DeleteSlotTypeVersion
    operation.  You can delete a version of a slot type only if it is not
    referenced. To delete a slot type that is referred to in one or more
    intents, you must remove those references first.    If you get the
    ResourceInUseException exception, the exception provides an example
    reference that shows the intent where the slot type is referenced. To remove
    the reference to the slot type, either update the intent or delete it. If
    you get the same exception when you attempt to delete the slot type again,
    repeat until the slot type has no references and the DeleteSlotType call is
    successful.   This operation requires permission for the lex:DeleteSlotType
    action.
