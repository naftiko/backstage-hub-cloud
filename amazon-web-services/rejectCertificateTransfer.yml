    Rejects a pending certificate transfer. After IoT rejects a certificate
    transfer, the certificate status changes from PENDING_TRANSFER to INACTIVE.
    To check for pending certificate transfers, call ListCertificates to
    enumerate your certificates. This operation can only be called by the
    transfer destination. After it is called, the certificate will be returned
    to the source's account in the INACTIVE state. Requires permission to access
    the RejectCertificateTransfer action.
