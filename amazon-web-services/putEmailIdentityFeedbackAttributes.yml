    Used to enable or disable feedback forwarding for an identity. This setting
    determines what happens when an identity is used to send an email that
    results in a bounce or complaint event. If the value is true, you receive
    email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. These
    notifications are sent to the address that you specified in the Return-Path
    header of the original email. You're required to have a method of tracking
    bounces and complaints. If you haven't set up another mechanism for
    receiving bounce or complaint notifications (for example, by setting up an
    event destination), you receive an email notification when these events
    occur (even if this setting is disabled).
