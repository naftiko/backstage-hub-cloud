  description: >-
    Creates a custom slot type or replaces an existing custom slot type. To
    create a custom slot type, specify a name for the slot type and a set of
    enumeration values, which are the values that a slot of this type can
    assume. For more information, see how-it-works. If you specify the name of
    an existing slot type, the fields in the request replace the existing values
    in the $LATEST version of the slot type. Amazon Lex removes the fields that
    you don't provide in the request. If you don't specify required fields,
    Amazon Lex throws an exception. When you update the $LATEST version of a
    slot type, if a bot uses the $LATEST version of an intent that contains the
    slot type, the bot's status field is set to NOT_BUILT. This operation
    requires permissions for the lex:PutSlotType action.
