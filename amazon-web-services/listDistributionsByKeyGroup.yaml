    Gets a list of distribution IDs for distributions that have a cache behavior
    that references the specified key group. You can optionally specify the
    maximum number of items to receive in the response. If the total number of
    items in the list exceeds the maximum that you specify, or the default
    maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next page of items, send a
    subsequent request that specifies the NextMarker value from the current
    response as the Marker value in the subsequent request.
