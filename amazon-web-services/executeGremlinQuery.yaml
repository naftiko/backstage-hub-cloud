  description: >-
    This commands executes a Gremlin query. Amazon Neptune is compatible with
    Apache TinkerPop3 and Gremlin, so you can use the Gremlin traversal language
    to query the graph, as described under The Graph in the Apache TinkerPop3
    documentation. More details can also be found in Accessing a Neptune graph
    with Gremlin. When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM
    authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must have a
    policy attached that enables one of the following IAM actions in that
    cluster, depending on the query:    neptune-db:ReadDataViaQuery    
    neptune-db:WriteDataViaQuery     neptune-db:DeleteDataViaQuery    Note that
    the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin IAM condition key can be used in the
    policy document to restrict the use of Gremlin queries (see Condition keys
    available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
