    Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used
    in conjunction with DeleteStreamKey to prevent further streaming to a
    channel.  Many streaming client-software libraries automatically reconnect a
    dropped RTMPS session, so to stop the stream permanently, you may want to
    first revoke the streamKey attached to the channel.
