    Updates your claimed phone number from its current Amazon Connect instance
    or traffic distribution group to another Amazon Connect instance or traffic
    distribution group in the same Amazon Web Services Region.  After using this
    API, you must verify that the phone number is attached to the correct flow
    in the target instance or traffic distribution group. You need to do this
    because the API switches only the phone number to a new instance or traffic
    distribution group. It doesn't migrate the flow configuration of the phone
    number, too. You can call DescribePhoneNumber API to verify the status of a
    previous UpdatePhoneNumber operation.
