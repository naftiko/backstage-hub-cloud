  description: >-
    Retrieves all available parent paths for any object type such as node, leaf
    node, policy node, and index node objects. For more information about
    objects, see Directory Structure. Use this API to evaluate all parents for
    an object. The call returns all objects from the root of the directory up to
    the requested object. The API returns the number of paths based on
    user-defined MaxResults, in case there are multiple paths to the parent. The
    order of the paths and nodes returned is consistent among multiple API calls
    unless the objects are deleted or moved. Paths not leading to the directory
    root are ignored from the target object.
