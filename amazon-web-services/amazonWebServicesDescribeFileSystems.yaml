  description: >-
    Returns the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if either the
    file system CreationToken or the FileSystemId is provided. Otherwise, it
    returns descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller's Amazon Web
    Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that
    you're calling. When retrieving all file system descriptions, you can
    optionally specify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number of
    descriptions in a response. This number is automatically set to 100. If more
    file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a NextMarker, an opaque
    token, in the response. In this case, you should send a subsequent request
    with the Marker request parameter set to the value of NextMarker.  To
    retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation is used in
    an iterative process, where DescribeFileSystems is called first without the
    Marker and then the operation continues to call it with the Marker parameter
    set to the value of the NextMarker from the previous response until the
    response has no NextMarker.   The order of file systems returned in the
    response of one DescribeFileSystems call and the order of file systems
    returned across the responses of a multi-call iteration is unspecified.  
    This operation requires permissions for the
    elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems action.
