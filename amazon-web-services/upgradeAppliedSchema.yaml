    Upgrades a single directory in-place using the PublishedSchemaArn with
    schema updates found in MinorVersion. Backwards-compatible minor version
    upgrades are instantaneously available for readers on all objects in the
    directory. Note: This is a synchronous API call and upgrades only one schema
    on a given directory per call. To upgrade multiple directories from one
    schema, you would need to call this API on each directory.
