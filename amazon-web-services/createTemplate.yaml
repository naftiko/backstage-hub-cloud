    Creates a template in the Cases domain. This template is used to define the
    case object model (that is, to define what data can be captured on cases) in
    a Cases domain. A template must have a unique name within a domain, and it
    must reference existing field IDs and layout IDs. Additionally, multiple
    fields with same IDs are not allowed within the same Template. A template
    can be either Active or Inactive, as indicated by its status. Inactive
    templates cannot be used to create cases.
