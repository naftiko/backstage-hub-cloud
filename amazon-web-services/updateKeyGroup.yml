    Updates a key group. When you update a key group, all the fields are updated
    with the values provided in the request. You cannot update some fields
    independent of others. To update a key group:   Get the current key group
    with GetKeyGroup or GetKeyGroupConfig.   Locally modify the fields in the
    key group that you want to update. For example, add or remove public key
    IDs.   Call UpdateKeyGroup with the entire key group object, including the
    fields that you modified and those that you didn't.
