    Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement
    tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various
    email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox
    placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that
    you plan to send to your customers. Amazon SES then sends that message to
    special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After
    about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the
    GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test.
