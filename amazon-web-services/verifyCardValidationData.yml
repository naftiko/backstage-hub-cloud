  description: >-
    Verifies card-related validation data using algorithms such as Card
    Verification Values (CVV/CVV2), Dynamic Card Verification Values
    (dCVV/dCVV2) and Card Security Codes (CSC). For more information, see Verify
    card data in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. This
    operation validates the CVV or CSC codes that is printed on a payment credit
    or debit card during card payment transaction. The input values are
    typically provided as part of an inbound transaction to an issuer or
    supporting platform partner. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses
    CVV or CSC, PAN (Primary Account Number) and expiration date of the card to
    check its validity during transaction processing. In this operation, the CVK
    (Card Verification Key) encryption key for use with card data verification
    is same as the one in used for GenerateCardValidationData.  For information
    about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and
    Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography User Guide.   Cross-account use: This operation can't be used
    across different Amazon Web Services accounts.  Related operations:
