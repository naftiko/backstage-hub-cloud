    Geocodes free-form text, such as an address, name, city, or region to allow
    you to search for Places or points of interest.  Optional parameters let you
    narrow your search results by bounding box or country, or bias your search
    toward a specific position on the globe.  You can search for places near a
    given position using BiasPosition, or filter results within a bounding box
    using FilterBBox. Providing both parameters simultaneously returns an
    error.  Search results are returned in order of highest to lowest relevance.
