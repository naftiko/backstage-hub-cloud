  description: >-
    Sets the package origin configuration for a package. The package origin
    configuration determines how new versions of a package can be added to a
    repository. You can allow or block direct publishing of new package
    versions, or ingestion and retaining of new package versions from an
    external connection or upstream source. For more information about package
    origin controls and configuration, see Editing package origin controls in
    the CodeArtifact User Guide.  PutPackageOriginConfiguration can be called on
    a package that doesn't yet exist in the repository. When called on a package
    that does not exist, a package is created in the repository with no versions
    and the requested restrictions are set on the package. This can be used to
    preemptively block ingesting or retaining any versions from external
    connections or upstream repositories, or to block publishing any versions of
    the package into the repository before connecting any package managers or
    publishers to the repository.
