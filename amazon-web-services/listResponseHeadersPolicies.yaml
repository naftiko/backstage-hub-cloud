  description: >-
    Gets a list of response headers policies. You can optionally apply a filter
    to get only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Services, or only the
    custom policies created in your Amazon Web Services account. You can
    optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the response.
    If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that you
    specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the next
    page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the NextMarker value
    from the current response as the Marker value in the subsequent request.
