    Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR. When an image is pushed, each new
    image layer is uploaded in parts. The maximum size of each image layer part
    can be 20971520 bytes (about 20MB). The UploadLayerPart API is called once
    for each new image layer part.  This operation is used by the Amazon ECR
    proxy and is not generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images.
    In most cases, you should use the docker CLI to pull, tag, and push images.
