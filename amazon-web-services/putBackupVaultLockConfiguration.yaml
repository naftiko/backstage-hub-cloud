    Applies Backup Vault Lock to a backup vault, preventing attempts to delete
    any recovery point stored in or created in a backup vault. Vault Lock also
    prevents attempts to update the lifecycle policy that controls the retention
    period of any recovery point currently stored in a backup vault. If
    specified, Vault Lock enforces a minimum and maximum retention period for
    future backup and copy jobs that target a backup vault.  Backup Vault Lock
    has been assessed by Cohasset Associates for use in environments that are
    subject to SEC 17a-4, CFTC, and FINRA regulations. For more information
    about how Backup Vault Lock relates to these regulations, see the Cohasset
    Associates Compliance Assessment.
