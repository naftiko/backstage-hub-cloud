  description: >-
    This operation downloads the output of the job you initiated using
    InitiateJob. Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the
    job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault
    inventory. You can download all the job output or download a portion of the
    output by specifying a byte range. In the case of an archive retrieval job,
    depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns
    the checksum for the portion of the data. You can compute the checksum on
    the client and verify that the values match to ensure the portion you
    downloaded is the correct data. A job ID will not expire for at least 24
    hours after Glacier completes the job. That a byte range. For both archive
    and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against
    the size returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. For
    archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you
    expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is
    based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a
    range of bytes=0-1048575, you should verify your download size is 1,048,576
    bytes. If you download an entire archive, the expected size is the size of
    the archive when you uploaded it to Amazon S3 Glacier The expected size is
    also returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. In the case
    of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify,
    Glacier returns the checksum for the portion of the data. To ensure the
    portion you downloaded is the correct data, compute the checksum on the
    client, verify that the values match, and verify that the size is what you
    expected. A job ID does not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier
    completes the job. That is, you can download the job output within the 24
    hours period after Amazon Glacier completes the job. An AWS account has full
    permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and
    Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You
    must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more

    (IAM). For conceptual information and the underlying REST API, see
