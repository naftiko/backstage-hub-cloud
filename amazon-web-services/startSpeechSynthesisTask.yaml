  description: >-
    Allows the creation of an asynchronous synthesis task, by starting a new
    SpeechSynthesisTask. This operation requires all the standard information
    needed for speech synthesis, plus the name of an Amazon S3 bucket for the
    service to store the output of the synthesis task and two optional
    parameters (OutputS3KeyPrefix and SnsTopicArn). Once the synthesis task is
    created, this operation will return a SpeechSynthesisTask object, which will
    include an identifier of this task as well as the current status. The
    SpeechSynthesisTask object is available for 72 hours after starting the
    asynchronous synthesis task.
