    Tests the auto-merging settings of your Identity Resolution Job without
    merging your data. It randomly selects a sample of matching groups from the
    existing matching results, and applies the automerging settings that you
    provided. You can then view the number of profiles in the sample, the number
    of matches, and the number of profiles identified to be merged. This enables
    you to evaluate the accuracy of the attributes in your matching list.  You
    can't view which profiles are matched and would be merged.  We strongly
    recommend you use this API to do a dry run of the automerging process before
    running the Identity Resolution Job. Include at least two matching
    attributes. If your matching list includes too few attributes (such as only
    FirstName or only LastName), there may be a large number of matches. This
    increases the chances of erroneous merges.
