    Provides information about the phone numbers for the specified Amazon
    Connect instance.  For more information about phone numbers, see Set Up
    Phone Numbers for Your Contact Center in the Amazon Connect Administrator
    Guide.    We recommend using ListPhoneNumbersV2 to return phone number
    types. ListPhoneNumbers doesn't support number types UIFN, SHARED,
    THIRD_PARTY_TF, and THIRD_PARTY_DID. While it returns numbers of those
    types, it incorrectly lists them as TOLL_FREE or DID.    The phone number
    Arn value that is returned from each of the items in the
    PhoneNumberSummaryList cannot be used to tag phone number resources. It will
    fail with a ResourceNotFoundException. Instead, use the ListPhoneNumbersV2
    API. It returns the new phone number ARN that can be used to tag phone
    number resources.
