    Removes the locally stored SSO tokens from the client-side cache and sends
    an API call to the IAM Identity Center service to invalidate the
    corresponding server-side IAM Identity Center sign in session.  If a user
    uses IAM Identity Center to access the AWS CLI, the user’s IAM Identity
    Center sign in session is used to obtain an IAM session, as specified in the
    corresponding IAM Identity Center permission set. More specifically, IAM
    Identity Center assumes an IAM role in the target account on behalf of the
    user, and the corresponding temporary AWS credentials are returned to the
    client. After user logout, any existing IAM role sessions that were created
    by using IAM Identity Center permission sets continue based on the duration
    configured in the permission set. For more information, see User
    authentications in the IAM Identity Center User Guide.
