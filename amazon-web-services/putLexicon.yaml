    Stores a pronunciation lexicon in an Amazon Web Services Region. If a
    lexicon with the same name already exists in the region, it is overwritten
    by the new lexicon. Lexicon operations have eventual consistency, therefore,
    it might take some time before the lexicon is available to the
    SynthesizeSpeech operation. For more information, see Managing Lexicons.
