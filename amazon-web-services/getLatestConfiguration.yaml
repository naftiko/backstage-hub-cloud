    Retrieves the latest deployed configuration. This API may return empty
    configuration data if the client already has the latest version. For more
    information about this API action and to view example CLI commands that show
    how to use it with the StartConfigurationSession API action, see Retrieving
    the configuration in the AppConfig User Guide.   Note the following
    important information.   Each configuration token is only valid for one call
    to GetLatestConfiguration. The GetLatestConfiguration response includes a
    NextPollConfigurationToken that should always replace the token used for the
    just-completed call in preparation for the next one.    
    GetLatestConfiguration is a priced call. For more information, see
    Pricing.
