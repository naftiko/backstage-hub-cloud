    Allows the update of one or more parameters of a database in Amazon
    Lightsail. Parameter updates don't cause outages; therefore, their
    application is not subject to the preferred maintenance window. However,
    there are two ways in which parameter updates are applied: dynamic or
    pending-reboot. Parameters marked with a dynamic apply type are applied
    immediately. Parameters marked with a pending-reboot apply type are applied
    only after the database is rebooted using the reboot relational database
    operation. The update relational database parameters operation supports
    tag-based access control via resource tags applied to the resource
    identified by relationalDatabaseName. For more information, see the Amazon
    Lightsail Developer Guide.
