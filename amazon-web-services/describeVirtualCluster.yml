  description: >-
    Displays detailed information about a specified virtual cluster. Virtual
    cluster is a managed entity on Amazon EMR on EKS. You can create, describe,
    list and delete virtual clusters. They do not consume any additional
    resource in your system. A single virtual cluster maps to a single
    Kubernetes namespace. Given this relationship, you can model virtual
    clusters the same way you model Kubernetes namespaces to meet your
    requirements.
