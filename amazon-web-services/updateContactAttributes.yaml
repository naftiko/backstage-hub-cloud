    Creates or updates user-defined contact attributes associated with the
    specified contact. You can create or update user-defined attributes for both
    ongoing and completed contacts. For example, while the call is active, you
    can update the customer's name or the reason the customer called. You can
    add notes about steps that the agent took during the call that display to
    the next agent that takes the call. You can also update attributes for a
    contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the
    contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional
    analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers. Contact
    attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then
    deleted. For information about contact record retention and the maximum size
    of the contact record attributes section, see Feature specifications in the
