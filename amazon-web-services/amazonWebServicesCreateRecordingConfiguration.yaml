    Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon
    S3.  Known issue: In the us-east-1 region, if you use the Amazon Web
    Services CLI to create a recording configuration, it returns success even if
    the S3 bucket is in a different region. In this case, the state of the
    recording configuration is CREATE_FAILED (instead of ACTIVE). (In other
    regions, the CLI correctly returns failure if the bucket is in a different
    region.)  Workaround: Ensure that your S3 bucket is in the same region as
    the recording configuration. If you create a recording configuration in a
    different region as your S3 bucket, delete that recording configuration and
    create a new one with an S3 bucket from the correct region.
