    Sends user input to Amazon Lex V2. You can send text or speech. Clients use
    this API to send text and audio requests to Amazon Lex V2 at runtime. Amazon
    Lex V2 interprets the user input using the machine learning model built for
    the bot. The following request fields must be compressed with gzip and then
    base64 encoded before you send them to Amazon Lex V2.    requestAttributes  
    sessionState   The following response fields are compressed using gzip and
    then base64 encoded by Amazon Lex V2. Before you can use these fields, you
    must decode and decompress them.    inputTranscript   interpretations  
    messages   requestAttributes   sessionState   The example contains a Java
    application that compresses and encodes a Java object to send to Amazon Lex
    V2, and a second that decodes and decompresses a response from Amazon Lex
    V2. If the optional post-fulfillment response is specified, the messages are
    returned as follows. For more information, see
    PostFulfillmentStatusSpecification.    Success message - Returned if the
    Lambda function completes successfully and the intent state is fulfilled or
    ready fulfillment if the message is present.    Failed message - The failed
    message is returned if the Lambda function throws an exception or if the
    Lambda function returns a failed intent state without a message.    Timeout
    message - If you don't configure a timeout message and a timeout, and the
    Lambda function doesn't return within 30 seconds, the timeout message is
    returned. If you configure a timeout, the timeout message is returned when
    the period times out.    For more information, see Completion message.
