    Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel
    ARN. Note that CreateChannel creates a stream key. If you subsequently use
    CreateStreamKey on the same channel, it will fail because a stream key
    already exists and there is a limit of 1 stream key per channel. To reset
    the stream key on a channel, use DeleteStreamKey and then CreateStreamKey.
