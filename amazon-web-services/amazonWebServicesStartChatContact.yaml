    Initiates a flow to start a new chat for the customer. Response of this API
    provides a token required to obtain credentials from the
    CreateParticipantConnection API in the Amazon Connect Participant Service.
    When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe to
    the participant’s connection for the created chat within 5 minutes. This is
    achieved by invoking CreateParticipantConnection with WEBSOCKET and
    CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.  A 429 error occurs in the following situations:  
    API rate limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a TooManyRequests
    exception.   The quota for concurrent active chats is exceeded. Active chat
    throttling returns a LimitExceededException.   If you use the
    ChatDurationInMinutes parameter and receive a 400 error, your account may
    not support the ability to configure custom chat durations. For more
    information, contact Amazon Web Services Support.  For more information
    about chat, see Chat in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.
