  description: >-
    This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to change.
    Creates a new queue for the specified Amazon Connect instance.    If the
    phone number is claimed to a traffic distribution group that was created in
    the same Region as the Amazon Connect instance where you are calling this
    API, then you can use a full phone number ARN or a UUID for
    OutboundCallerIdNumberId. However, if the phone number is claimed to a
    traffic distribution group that is in one Region, and you are calling this
    API from an instance in another Amazon Web Services Region that is
    associated with the traffic distribution group, you must provide a full
    phone number ARN. If a UUID is provided in this scenario, you will receive a
    ResourceNotFoundException.   Only use the phone number ARN format that
    doesn't contain instance in the path, for example,
    arn:aws:connect:us-east-1:1234567890:phone-number/uuid. This is the same ARN
    format that is returned when you call the ListPhoneNumbersV2 API.   If you
    plan to use IAM policies to allow/deny access to this API for phone number
    resources claimed to a traffic distribution group, see Allow or Deny queue
    API actions for phone numbers in a replica Region.
