    Updates a gateway capability configuration or defines a new capability
    configuration. Each gateway capability defines data sources for a gateway. A
    capability configuration can contain multiple data source configurations. If
    you define OPC-UA sources for a gateway in the IoT SiteWise console, all of
    your OPC-UA sources are stored in one capability configuration. To list all
