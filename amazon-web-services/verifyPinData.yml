    Verifies pin-related data such as PIN and PIN Offset using algorithms
    including VISA PVV and IBM3624. For more information, see Verify PIN data in
    the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. This operation
    verifies PIN data for user payment card. A card holder PIN data is never
    transmitted in clear to or from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.
    This operation uses PIN Verification Key (PVK) for PIN or PIN Offset
    generation and then encrypts it using PIN Encryption Key (PEK) to create an
    EncryptedPinBlock for transmission from Amazon Web Services Payment
    Cryptography.  For information about valid keys for this operation, see
    Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in
    the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.   Cross-account
    use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services
    accounts.  Related operations:     GeneratePinData     TranslatePinData
