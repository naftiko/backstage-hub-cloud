  description: >-
    Retrieves summary metrics for the stages within intents in your bot. The
    following fields are required:    metrics – A list of
    AnalyticsIntentStageMetric objects. In each object, use the name field to
    specify the metric to calculate, the statistic field to specify whether to
    calculate the Sum, Average, or Max number, and the order field to specify
    whether to sort the results in Ascending or Descending order.   
    startDateTime and endDateTime – Define a time range for which you want to
    retrieve results.   Of the optional fields, you can organize the results in
    the following ways:   Use the filters field to filter the results, the
    groupBy field to specify categories by which to group the results, and the
    binBy field to specify time intervals by which to group the results.   Use
    the maxResults field to limit the number of results to return in a single
    response and the nextToken field to return the next batch of results if the
    response does not return the full set of results.   Note that an order field
    exists in both binBy and metrics. You can only specify one order in a given
    request.
