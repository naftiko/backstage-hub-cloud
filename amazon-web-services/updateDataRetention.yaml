    Increases or decreases the stream's data retention period by the value that
    you specify. To indicate whether you want to increase or decrease the data
    retention period, specify the Operation parameter in the request body. In
    the request, you must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN.  This
    operation requires permission for the KinesisVideo:UpdateDataRetention
    action. Changing the data retention period affects the data in the stream as
    follows:   If the data retention period is increased, existing data is
    retained for the new retention period. For example, if the data retention
    period is increased from one hour to seven hours, all existing data is
    retained for seven hours.   If the data retention period is decreased,
    existing data is retained for the new retention period. For example, if the
    data retention period is decreased from seven hours to one hour, all
    existing data is retained for one hour, and any data older than one hour is
    deleted immediately.
