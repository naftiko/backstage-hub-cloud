    Creates resource record sets in a specified hosted zone based on the
    settings in a specified traffic policy version. In addition,
    CreateTrafficPolicyInstance associates the resource record sets with a
    specified domain name (such as example.com) or subdomain name (such as
    www.example.com). Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries for the domain or
    subdomain name by using the resource record sets that
    CreateTrafficPolicyInstance created.  After you submit an
    CreateTrafficPolicyInstance request, there's a brief delay while Amazon
    Route 53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traffic
    policy definition. Use GetTrafficPolicyInstance with the id of new traffic
    policy instance to confirm that the CreateTrafficPolicyInstance request
    completed successfully. For more information, see the State response
    element.
