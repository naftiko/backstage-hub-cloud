    Returns the list of component build versions for the specified semantic
    version.  The semantic version has four nodes:
    &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;/&lt;build&gt;. You can assign
    values for the first three, and can filter on all of them.  Filtering: With
    semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to use wildcards (x) to
    specify the most recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or
    components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes
    to the right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards.
