    Retrieves the results of a running or completed experiment. No results are
    available until there have been 100 events for each variation and at least
    10 minutes have passed since the start of the experiment. To increase the
    statistical power, Evidently performs an additional offline p-value analysis
    at the end of the experiment. Offline p-value analysis can detect
    statistical significance in some cases where the anytime p-values used
    during the experiment do not find statistical significance. Experiment
    results are available up to 63 days after the start of the experiment. They
    are not available after that because of CloudWatch data retention policies.
