  description: >-
    Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech
    synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or female,
    and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice name. 
    When synthesizing speech ( SynthesizeSpeech ), you provide the voice ID for
    the voice you want from the list of voices returned by DescribeVoices. For
    example, you want your news reader application to read news in a specific
    language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using the
    DescribeVoices operation you can provide the user with a list of available
    voices to select from.  You can optionally specify a language code to filter
    the available voices. For example, if you specify en-US, the operation
    returns a list of all available US English voices.  This operation requires
    permissions to perform the polly:DescribeVoices action.
