  name: Setvaultnotifications
  description: >-
    This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific
    events happen to a vault. By default, you don't get any notifications. To
    configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to the
    notification-configuration subresource of the vault. The request should
    include a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and specific
    events for which you want Amazon S3 Glacier to send notifications to the
    topic. Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be allowed to
    publish notifications to the topic. You can configure a vault to publish a
    notification for the following vault events:    ArchiveRetrievalCompleted
    This event occurs when a job that was initiated for an archive retrieval is
    completed (InitiateJob). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded"
    or "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as
    returned from DescribeJob.     InventoryRetrievalCompleted This event occurs
    when a job that was initiated for an inventory retrieval is completed
    (InitiateJob). The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or
    "Failed". The notification sent to the SNS topic is the same output as
    returned from DescribeJob.    An AWS account has full permission to perform
    all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
    permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access
    Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For conceptual
    information and underlying REST API, see Configuring Vault Notifications in
    Amazon S3 Glacier and Set Vault Notification Configuration  in the Amazon
    Glacier Developer Guide.
