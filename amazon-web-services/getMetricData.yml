  description: >-
    Gets historical metric data from the specified Amazon Connect instance. For
    a description of each historical metric, see Historical Metrics Definitions
    in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.  We recommend using the
    GetMetricDataV2 API. It provides more flexibility, features, and the ability
    to query longer time ranges than GetMetricData. Use it to retrieve
    historical agent and contact metrics for the last 3 months, at varying
    intervals. You can also use it to build custom dashboards to measure
    historical queue and agent performance. For example, you can track the
    number of incoming contacts for the last 7 days, with data split by day, to
    see how contact volume changed per day of the week.
