    Publishes a CloudFront function by copying the function code from the
    DEVELOPMENT stage to LIVE. This automatically updates all cache behaviors
    that are using this function to use the newly published copy in the LIVE
    stage. When a function is published to the LIVE stage, you can attach the
    function to a distribution's cache behavior, using the function's Amazon
    Resource Name (ARN). To publish a function, you must provide the function's
    name and version (ETag value). To get these values, you can use
    ListFunctions and DescribeFunction.
