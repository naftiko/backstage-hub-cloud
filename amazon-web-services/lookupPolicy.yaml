    Lists all policies from the root of the Directory to the object specified.
    If there are no policies present, an empty list is returned. If policies are
    present, and if some objects don't have the policies attached, it returns
    the ObjectIdentifier for such objects. If policies are present, it returns
    ObjectIdentifier, policyId, and policyType. Paths that don't lead to the
    root from the target object are ignored. For more information, see Policies.
