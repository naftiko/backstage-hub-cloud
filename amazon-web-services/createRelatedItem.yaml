    Creates a related item (comments, tasks, and contacts) and associates it
    with a case.    A Related Item is a resource that is associated with a case.
    It may or may not have an external identifier linking it to an external
    resource (for example, a contactArn). All Related Items have their own
    internal identifier, the relatedItemArn. Examples of related items include
    comments and contacts.   If you provide a value for performedBy.userArn you
    must also have DescribeUser permission on the ARN of the user that you
    provide.    &lt;/note&gt;
