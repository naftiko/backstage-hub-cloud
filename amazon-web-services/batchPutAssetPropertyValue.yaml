    Sends a list of asset property values to IoT SiteWise. Each value is a
    timestamp-quality-value (TQV) data point. For more information, see
    Ingesting data using the API in the IoT SiteWise User Guide. To identify an
    asset property, you must specify one of the following:   The assetId and
    propertyId of an asset property.   A propertyAlias, which is a data stream
    alias (for example, /company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature). To define an
    asset property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty.    With respect to Unix
    epoch time, IoT SiteWise accepts only TQVs that have a timestamp of no more
    than 7 days in the past and no more than 10 minutes in the future. IoT
    SiteWise rejects timestamps outside of the inclusive range of [-7 days, +10
    minutes] and returns a TimestampOutOfRangeException error. For each asset
    property, IoT SiteWise overwrites TQVs with duplicate timestamps unless the
    newer TQV has a different quality. For example, if you store a TQV {T1,
    GOOD, V1}, then storing {T1, GOOD, V2} replaces the existing TQV.  IoT
    SiteWise authorizes access to each BatchPutAssetPropertyValue entry
    individually. For more information, see BatchPutAssetPropertyValue
    authorization in the IoT SiteWise User Guide.
