    Asynchronously uploads one or more entity definitions to the user's
    namespace. The document parameter is required if syncWithPublicNamespace and
    deleteExistingEntites are false. If the syncWithPublicNamespace parameter is
    set to true, the user's namespace will synchronize with the latest version
    of the public namespace. If deprecateExistingEntities is set to true, all
    entities in the latest version will be deleted before the new
    DefinitionDocument is uploaded. When a user uploads entity definitions for
    the first time, the service creates a new namespace for the user. The new
    namespace tracks the public namespace. Currently users can have only one
    namespace. The namespace version increments whenever a user uploads entity
    definitions that are backwards-incompatible and whenever a user sets the
    syncWithPublicNamespace parameter or the deprecateExistingEntities parameter
    to true. The IDs for all of the entities should be in URN format. Each
    entity must be in the user's namespace. Users can't create entities in the
    public namespace, but entity definitions can refer to entities in the public
    namespace. Valid entities are Device, DeviceModel, Service, Capability,
    State, Action, Event, Property, Mapping, Enum.
