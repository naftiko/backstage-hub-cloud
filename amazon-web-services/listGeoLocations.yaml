metadata:

  description: >-
    Retrieves a list of supported geographic locations. Countries are listed
    first, and continents are listed last. If Amazon Route 53 supports
    subdivisions for a country (for example, states or provinces), the
    subdivisions for that country are listed in alphabetical order immediately
    after the corresponding country. Route 53 does not perform authorization for
    this API because it retrieves information that is already available to the
    public. For a list of supported geolocation codes, see the GeoLocation data
    type.
