  description: >-
    This operation lists all vaults owned by the calling user's account. The
    list returned in the response is ASCII-sorted by vault name. By default,
    this operation returns up to 10 items. If there are more vaults to list, the
    response marker field contains the vault Amazon Resource Name (ARN) at which
    to continue the list with a new List Vaults request; otherwise, the marker
    field is null. To return a list of vaults that begins at a specific vault,
    set the marker request parameter to the vault ARN you obtained from a
    previous List Vaults request. You can also limit the number of vaults
    returned in the response by specifying the limit parameter in the request. 
    An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
    However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
    permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform
    specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS
    Identity and Access Management (IAM). For conceptual information and
    underlying REST API, see Retrieving Vault Metadata in Amazon S3 Glacier and
    List Vaults  in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.
