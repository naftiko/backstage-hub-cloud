  description: >-
    The fast reset REST API lets you reset a Neptune graph quicky and easily,
    removing all of its data. Neptune fast reset is a two-step process. First
    you call ExecuteFastReset with action set to initiateDatabaseReset. This
    returns a UUID token which you then include when calling ExecuteFastReset
    again with action set to performDatabaseReset. See Empty an Amazon Neptune
    DB cluster using the fast reset API. When invoking this operation in a
    Neptune cluster that has IAM authentication enabled, the IAM user or role
    making the request must have a policy attached that allows the
    neptune-db:ResetDatabase IAM action in that cluster.
