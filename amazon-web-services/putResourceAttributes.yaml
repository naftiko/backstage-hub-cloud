  description: >-
    Provides identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it can
    be associated in the Application Discovery Service repository. This
    association occurs asynchronously after PutResourceAttributes returns.   
    Keep in mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will override
    previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first called with a MAC
    address, but later, it is desired to add an IP address, it will then be
    required to call it with both the IP and MAC addresses to prevent overriding
    the MAC address.   Note the instructions regarding the special use case of
    the  ResourceAttributeList  parameter when specifying any "VM" related
    value.     Because this is an asynchronous call, it will always return 200,
    whether an association occurs or not. To confirm if an association was found
    based on the provided details, call ListDiscoveredResources.
