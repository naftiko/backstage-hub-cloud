    Sets the maximum number of simultaneous executions for a function, and
    reserves capacity for that concurrency level. Concurrency settings apply to
    the function as a whole, including all published versions and the
    unpublished version. Reserving concurrency both ensures that your function
    has capacity to process the specified number of events simultaneously, and
    prevents it from scaling beyond that level. Use GetFunction to see the
    current setting for a function. Use GetAccountSettings to see your Regional
    concurrency limit. You can reserve concurrency for as many functions as you
    like, as long as you leave at least 100 simultaneous executions unreserved
    for functions that aren't configured with a per-function limit. For more
    information, see Lambda function scaling.
