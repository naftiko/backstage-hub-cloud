    This API allows you to connect WebRTC-enabled devices with Alexa display
    devices. When invoked, it sends the Alexa Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    offer to the master peer. The offer is delivered as soon as the master is
    connected to the specified signaling channel. This API returns the SDP
    answer from the connected master. If the master is not connected to the
    signaling channel, redelivery requests are made until the message expires.
