    List the tables in a database. If neither SchemaPattern nor TablePattern are
    specified, then all tables in the database are returned. A token is returned
    to page through the table list. Depending on the authorization method, use
    one of the following combinations of request parameters:    Secrets Manager
    - when connecting to a cluster, provide the secret-arn of a secret stored in
    Secrets Manager which has username and password. The specified secret
    contains credentials to connect to the database you specify. When you are
    connecting to a cluster, you also supply the database name, If you provide a
    cluster identifier (dbClusterIdentifier), it must match the cluster
    identifier stored in the secret. When you are connecting to a serverless
    workgroup, you also supply the database name.   Temporary credentials - when
    connecting to your data warehouse, choose one of the following options:  
    When connecting to a serverless workgroup, specify the workgroup name and
    database name. The database user name is derived from the IAM identity. For
    example, arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo has the database user name IAM:foo.
    Also, permission to call the redshift-serverless:GetCredentials operation is
    required.   When connecting to a cluster as an IAM identity, specify the
    cluster identifier and the database name. The database user name is derived
    from the IAM identity. For example, arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo has the
    database user name IAM:foo. Also, permission to call the
    redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM operation is required.   When
    connecting to a cluster as a database user, specify the cluster identifier,
    the database name, and the database user name. Also, permission to call the
    redshift:GetClusterCredentials operation is required.     For more
