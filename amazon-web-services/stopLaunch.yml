  description: >-
    Stops a launch that is currently running. After you stop a launch, you will
    not be able to resume it or restart it. Also, it will not be evaluated as a
    rule for traffic allocation, and the traffic that was allocated to the
    launch will instead be available to the feature's experiment, if there is
    one. Otherwise, all traffic will be served the default variation after the
    launch is stopped.
