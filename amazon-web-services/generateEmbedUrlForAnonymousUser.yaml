    Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
    dashboard or visual in your website, without having to register any reader
    users. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the
    dashboards and permissions. The following rules apply to the generated
    URL:   It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after
    it is generated. Once redeemed within this period, it cannot be re-used
    again.   The URL validity period should not be confused with the actual
    session lifetime that can be customized using the  SessionLifetimeInMinutes 
    parameter. The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (minimum) to
    10 hours (maximum). The default session duration is 10 hours.   You are
    charged only when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon
    QuickSight.   For more information, see Embedded Analytics in the Amazon
    QuickSight User Guide. For more information about the high-level steps for
    embedding and for an interactive demo of the ways you can customize
    embedding, visit the Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal.
