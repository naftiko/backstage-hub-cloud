    Retrieves a list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The response
    includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted zone created by the
    current Amazon Web Services account.   ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted
    zones by name with the labels reversed. For example:  com.example.www.  Note
    the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some circumstances. If
    the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode,
    ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or
    Punycoded value, which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its
    database. For example, to create a hosted zone for exämple.com, you specify
    ex\344mple.com for the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes it
    as:  com.ex\344mple.  The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the
    escaped value. For more information about valid domain name formats,
    including internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the
    Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each
    response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, use the MaxItems parameter to
    list them in groups of up to 100. The response includes values that help
    navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to the next:   The DNSName
    and HostedZoneId elements in the response contain the values, if any,
    specified for the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters in the request that
    produced the current response.   The MaxItems element in the response
    contains the value, if any, that you specified for the maxitems parameter in
    the request that produced the current response.   If the value of
    IsTruncated in the response is true, there are more hosted zones associated
    with the current Amazon Web Services account.  If IsTruncated is false, this
    response includes the last hosted zone that is associated with the current
    account. The NextDNSName element and NextHostedZoneId elements are omitted
    from the response.   The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements in the
    response contain the domain name and the hosted zone ID of the next hosted
    zone that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services account. If you
    want to list more hosted zones, make another call to ListHostedZonesByName,
    and specify the value of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in the dnsname and
    hostedzoneid parameters, respectively.
