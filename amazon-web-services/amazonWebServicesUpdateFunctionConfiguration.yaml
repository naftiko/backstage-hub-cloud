    Modify the version-specific settings of a Lambda function. When you update a
    function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting
    resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
    minute. During this time, you can't modify the function, but you can still
    invoke it. The LastUpdateStatus, LastUpdateStatusReason, and
    LastUpdateStatusReasonCode fields in the response from
    GetFunctionConfiguration indicate when the update is complete and the
    function is processing events with the new configuration. For more
    information, see Lambda function states. These settings can vary between
    versions of a function and are locked when you publish a version. You can't
    modify the configuration of a published version, only the unpublished
    version. To configure function concurrency, use PutFunctionConcurrency. To
    grant invoke permissions to an Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web
    Service, use AddPermission.
