  description: >-
    After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting
    services, your client applications use this API to get inferences from the
    model hosted at the specified endpoint.  For an overview of Amazon
    SageMaker, see How It Works.  Amazon SageMaker strips all POST headers
    except those supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional
    headers. You should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those
    enumerated in the request syntax.  Calls to InvokeEndpoint are authenticated
    by using Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For information, see
    Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the
    Amazon S3 API Reference. A customer's model containers must respond to
    requests within 60 seconds. The model itself can have a maximum processing
    time of 60 seconds before responding to invocations. If your model is going
    to take 50-60 seconds of processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be
    set to be 70 seconds.  Endpoints are scoped to an individual account, and
    are not public. The URL does not contain the account ID, but Amazon
    SageMaker determines the account ID from the authentication token that is
    supplied by the caller.
