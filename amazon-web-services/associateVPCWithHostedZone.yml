    Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone.   To perform the
    association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already exist. You
    can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.   If you want
    to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web Services account
    with a private hosted zone that was created by using a different account,
    the Amazon Web Services account that created the private hosted zone must
    first submit a CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization request. Then the account
    that created the VPC must submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request.  
    When granting access, the hosted zone and the Amazon VPC must belong to the
    same partition. A partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each
    Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition. The following are
    the supported partitions:    aws - Amazon Web Services Regions    aws-cn -
    China Regions    aws-us-gov - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region   For
    more information, see Access Management in the Amazon Web Services General
    Reference.
