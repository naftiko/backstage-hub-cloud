    Updates an event source mapping. You can change the function that Lambda
    invokes, or pause invocation and resume later from the same location. For
    details about how to configure different event sources, see the following
    topics.      Amazon DynamoDB Streams      Amazon Kinesis      Amazon
    SQS      Amazon MQ and RabbitMQ      Amazon MSK      Apache Kafka     
    Amazon DocumentDB    The following error handling options are available only
    for stream sources (DynamoDB and Kinesis):    BisectBatchOnFunctionError –
    If the function returns an error, split the batch in two and retry.   
    DestinationConfig – Send discarded records to an Amazon SQS queue or Amazon
    SNS topic.    MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds – Discard records older than the
    specified age. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite
    (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires   
    MaximumRetryAttempts – Discard records after the specified number of
    retries. The default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite (-1),
    failed records are retried until the record expires.   
    ParallelizationFactor – Process multiple batches from each shard
    concurrently.   For information about which configuration parameters apply
    to each event source, see the following topics.     Amazon DynamoDB
