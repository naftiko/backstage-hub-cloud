  description: >-
    Gets a list of distributions that have a cache behavior that's associated
    with the specified real-time log configuration. You can specify the
    real-time log configuration by its name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
    You must provide at least one. If you provide both, CloudFront uses the name
    to identify the real-time log configuration to list distributions for. You
    can optionally specify the maximum number of items to receive in the
    response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the maximum that
    you specify, or the default maximum, the response is paginated. To get the
    next page of items, send a subsequent request that specifies the NextMarker
    value from the current response as the Marker value in the subsequent
    request.
