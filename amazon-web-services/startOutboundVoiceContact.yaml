  description: >-
    Places an outbound call to a contact, and then initiates the flow. It
    performs the actions in the flow that's specified (in ContactFlowId). Agents
    do not initiate the outbound API, which means that they do not dial the
    contact. If the flow places an outbound call to a contact, and then puts the
    contact in queue, the call is then routed to the agent, like any other
    inbound case. There is a 60-second dialing timeout for this operation. If
    the call is not connected after 60 seconds, it fails.  UK numbers with a 447
    prefix are not allowed by default. Before you can dial these UK mobile
    numbers, you must submit a service quota increase request. For more
    information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas in the Amazon Connect
    Administrator Guide.    Campaign calls are not allowed by default. Before
    you can make a call with TrafficType = CAMPAIGN, you must submit a service
    quota increase request to the quota Amazon Connect campaigns.
