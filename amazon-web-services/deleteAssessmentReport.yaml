    Deletes an assessment report in Audit Manager.  When you run the
    DeleteAssessmentReport operation, Audit Manager attempts to delete the
    following data:   The specified assessment report that’s stored in your S3
    bucket   The associated metadata that’s stored in Audit Manager   If Audit
    Manager can’t access the assessment report in your S3 bucket, the report
    isn’t deleted. In this event, the DeleteAssessmentReport operation doesn’t
    fail. Instead, it proceeds to delete the associated metadata only. You must
    then delete the assessment report from the S3 bucket yourself.  This
    scenario happens when Audit Manager receives a 403 (Forbidden) or 404 (Not
    Found) error from Amazon S3. To avoid this, make sure that your S3 bucket is
    available, and that you configured the correct permissions for Audit Manager
    to delete resources in your S3 bucket. For an example permissions policy
    that you can use, see Assessment report destination permissions in the Audit
    Manager User Guide. For information about the issues that could cause a 403
    (Forbidden) or 404 (Not Found) error from Amazon S3, see List of Error Codes
    in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference.
