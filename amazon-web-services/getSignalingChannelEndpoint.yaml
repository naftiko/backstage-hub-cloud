  name: getsignalingchannelendpoint
  description: >-
    Provides an endpoint for the specified signaling channel to send and receive
    messages. This API uses the SingleMasterChannelEndpointConfiguration input
    parameter, which consists of the Protocols and Role properties.  Protocols
    is used to determine the communication mechanism. For example, if you
    specify WSS as the protocol, this API produces a secure websocket endpoint.
    If you specify HTTPS as the protocol, this API generates an HTTPS
    endpoint.   Role determines the messaging permissions. A MASTER role results
    in this API generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate with
    any of the viewers on the channel. A VIEWER role results in this API
    generating an endpoint that a client can use to communicate only with a
    MASTER.
