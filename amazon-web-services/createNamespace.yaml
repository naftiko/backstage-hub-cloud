    (Enterprise edition only) Creates a new namespace for you to use with Amazon
    QuickSight. A namespace allows you to isolate the Amazon QuickSight users
    and groups that are registered for that namespace. Users that access the
    namespace can share assets only with other users or groups in the same
    namespace. They can't see users and groups in other namespaces. You can
    create a namespace after your Amazon Web Services account is subscribed to
    Amazon QuickSight. The namespace must be unique within the Amazon Web
    Services account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per Amazon
    Web Services account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with Amazon
    Web Services Support.
