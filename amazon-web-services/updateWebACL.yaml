    Updates the specified WebACL. While updating a web ACL, WAF provides
    continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated with the web
    ACL.   This operation completely replaces the mutable specifications that
    you already have for the web ACL with the ones that you provide to this
    call.  To modify a web ACL, do the following:    Retrieve it by calling
    GetWebACL    Update its settings as needed   Provide the complete web ACL
    specification to this call     A web ACL defines a collection of rules to
    use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that
    defines what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to
    requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default
    action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the
    rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types Rule,
    RuleGroup, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or
    more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an
    Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an
    Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user
    pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access
    instance.   Temporary inconsistencies during updates  When you create or
    change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of
    time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The
    propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.  The
    following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might
    notice during change propagation:    After you create a web ACL, if you try
    to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that
    the web ACL is unavailable.    After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the
    new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is
    used and not in another.   After you change a rule action setting, you might
    see the old action in some places and the new action in others.    After you
    add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new
    address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.
