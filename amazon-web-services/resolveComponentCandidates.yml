    Retrieves a list of components that meet the component, version, and
    platform requirements of a deployment. Greengrass core devices call this
    operation when they receive a deployment to identify the components to
    install. This operation identifies components that meet all dependency
    requirements for a deployment. If the requirements conflict, then this
    operation returns an error and the deployment fails. For example, this
    occurs if component A requires version &gt;2.0.0 and component B requires
    version &lt;2.0.0 of a component dependency. When you specify the component
    candidates to resolve, IoT Greengrass compares each component's digest from
    the core device with the component's digest in the Amazon Web Services
    Cloud. If the digests don't match, then IoT Greengrass specifies to use the
    version from the Amazon Web Services Cloud.  To use this operation, you must
    use the data plane API endpoint and authenticate with an IoT device
    certificate. For more information, see IoT Greengrass endpoints and quotas.
