  description: >-
    Updates the identity information for the specified user.  We strongly
    recommend limiting who has the ability to invoke UpdateUserIdentityInfo.
    Someone with that ability can change the login credentials of other users by
    changing their email address. This poses a security risk to your
    organization. They can change the email address of a user to the attacker's
    email address, and then reset the password through email. For more
    information, see Best Practices for Security Profiles in the Amazon Connect
    Administrator Guide.
