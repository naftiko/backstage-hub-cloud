    Update an existing pipe. When you call UpdatePipe, EventBridge only the
    updates fields you have specified in the request; the rest remain unchanged.
    The exception to this is if you modify any Amazon Web Services-service
    specific fields in the SourceParameters, EnrichmentParameters, or
    TargetParameters objects. For example, DynamoDBStreamParameters or
    EventBridgeEventBusParameters. EventBridge updates the fields in these
    objects atomically as one and overrides existing values. This is by design,
    and means that if you don't specify an optional field in one of these
    Parameters objects, EventBridge sets that field to its system-default value
    during the update. For more information about pipes, see  Amazon EventBridge
    Pipes in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
