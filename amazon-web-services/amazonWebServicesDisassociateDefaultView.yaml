    After you call this operation, the affected Amazon Web Services Region no
    longer has a default view. All Search operations in that Region must
    explicitly specify a view or the operation fails. You can configure a new
    default by calling the AssociateDefaultView operation. If an Amazon Web
    Services Region doesn't have a default view configured, then users must
    explicitly specify a view with every Search operation performed in that
    Region.
