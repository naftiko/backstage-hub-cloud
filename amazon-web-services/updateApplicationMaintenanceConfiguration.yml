    Updates the maintenance configuration of the Kinesis Data Analytics
    application.  You can invoke this operation on an application that is in one
    of the two following states: READY or RUNNING. If you invoke it when the
    application is in a state other than these two states, it throws a
    ResourceInUseException. The service makes use of the updated configuration
    the next time it schedules maintenance for the application. If you invoke
    this operation after the service schedules maintenance, the service will
    apply the configuration update the next time it schedules maintenance for
    the application. This means that you might not see the maintenance
    configuration update applied to the maintenance process that follows a
    successful invocation of this operation, but to the following maintenance
    process instead. To see the current maintenance configuration of your
    application, invoke the DescribeApplication operation. For information about
    application maintenance, see Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink
    Maintenance.  This operation is supported only for Amazon Kinesis Data
    Analytics for Apache Flink.
