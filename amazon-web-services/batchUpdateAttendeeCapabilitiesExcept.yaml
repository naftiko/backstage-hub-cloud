    Updates AttendeeCapabilities except the capabilities listed in an
    ExcludedAttendeeIds table.  You use the capabilities with a set of values
    that control what the capabilities can do, such as SendReceive data. For
    more information about those values, see .  When using capabilities, be
    aware of these corner cases:   If you specify
    MeetingFeatures:Video:MaxResolution:None when you create a meeting, all API
    requests that include SendReceive, Send, or Receive for
    AttendeeCapabilities:Video will be rejected with ValidationError 400.   If
    you specify MeetingFeatures:Content:MaxResolution:None when you create a
    meeting, all API requests that include SendReceive, Send, or Receive for
    AttendeeCapabilities:Content will be rejected with ValidationError 400.  
    You can't set content capabilities to SendReceive or Receive unless you also
    set video capabilities to SendReceive or Receive. If you don't set the video
    capability to receive, the response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request
    status code. However, you can set your video capability to receive and you
    set your content capability to not receive.   When you change an audio
    capability from None or Receive to Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee
    left their microphone unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the
    other meeting participants.   When you change a video or content capability
    from None or Receive to Send or SendReceive , and if the attendee turned on
    their video or content streams, remote attendees can receive those streams,
    but only after media renegotiation between the client and the Amazon Chime
    back-end server.
