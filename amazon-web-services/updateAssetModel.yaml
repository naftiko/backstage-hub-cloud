  description: >-
    Updates an asset model and all of the assets that were created from the
    model. Each asset created from the model inherits the updated asset model's
    property and hierarchy definitions. For more information, see Updating
    assets and models in the IoT SiteWise User Guide.  This operation overwrites
    the existing model with the provided model. To avoid deleting your asset
    model's properties or hierarchies, you must include their IDs and
    definitions in the updated asset model payload. For more information, see
    DescribeAssetModel. If you remove a property from an asset model, IoT
    SiteWise deletes all previous data for that property. If you remove a
    hierarchy definition from an asset model, IoT SiteWise disassociates every
    asset associated with that hierarchy. You can't change the type or data type
    of an existing property.
