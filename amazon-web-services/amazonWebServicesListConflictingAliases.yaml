  description: >-
    Gets a list of aliases (also called CNAMEs or alternate domain names) that
    conflict or overlap with the provided alias, and the associated CloudFront
    distributions and Amazon Web Services accounts for each conflicting alias.
    In the returned list, the distribution and account IDs are partially hidden,
    which allows you to identify the distributions and accounts that you own,
    but helps to protect the information of ones that you don't own. Use this
    operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that conflict or
    overlap with the provided alias. For example, if you provide www.example.com
    as input, the returned list can include www.example.com and the overlapping
    wildcard alternate domain name (*.example.com), if they exist. If you
    provide *.example.com as input, the returned list can include *.example.com
    and any alternate domain names covered by that wildcard (for example,
    www.example.com, test.example.com, dev.example.com, and so on), if they
    exist. To list conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the
    ID of a distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS
    certificate that includes the provided alias. For more information,
    including how to set up the distribution and certificate, see Moving an
    alternate domain name to a different distribution in the Amazon CloudFront
    Developer Guide. You can optionally specify the maximum number of items to
    receive in the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds
    the maximum that you specify, or the default maximum, the response is
    paginated. To get the next page of items, send a subsequent request that
    specifies the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker value
    in the subsequent request.
