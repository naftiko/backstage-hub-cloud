    Associates an alias (also known as a CNAME or an alternate domain name) with
    a CloudFront distribution. With this operation you can move an alias that's
    already in use on a CloudFront distribution to a different distribution in
    one step. This prevents the downtime that could occur if you first remove
    the alias from one distribution and then separately add the alias to another
    distribution. To use this operation to associate an alias with a
    distribution, you provide the alias and the ID of the target distribution
    for the alias. For more information, including how to set up the target
    distribution, prerequisites that you must complete, and other restrictions,
    see Moving an alternate domain name to a different distribution in the
    Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.
