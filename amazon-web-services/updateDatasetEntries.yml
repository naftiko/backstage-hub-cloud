  description: >-
    Adds or updates one or more JSON Line entries in a dataset. A JSON Line
    includes information about an image used for training or testing an Amazon
    Lookout for Vision model. To update an existing JSON Line, use the
    source-ref field to identify the JSON Line. The JSON line that you supply
    replaces the existing JSON line. Any existing annotations that are not in
    the new JSON line are removed from the dataset.  For more information, see
    Defining JSON lines for anomaly classification in the Amazon Lookout for
    Vision Developer Guide.   The images you reference in the source-ref field
    of a JSON line, must be in the same S3 bucket as the existing images in the
    dataset.   Updating a dataset might take a while to complete. To check the
    current status, call DescribeDataset and check the Status field in the
    response. This operation requires permissions to perform the
    lookoutvision:UpdateDatasetEntries operation.
