    Starts a request for the descriptive bot builder to generate a bot locale
    configuration based on the prompt you provide it. After you make this call,
    use the DescribeBotResourceGeneration operation to check on the status of
    the generation and for the generatedBotLocaleUrl when the generation is
    complete. Use that value to retrieve the Amazon S3 object containing the bot
    locale configuration. You can then modify and import this configuration.
