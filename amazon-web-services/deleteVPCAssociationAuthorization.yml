  description: >-
    Removes authorization to submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request to
    associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different
    account. You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a
    DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization request.  Sending this request only
    prevents the Amazon Web Services account that created the VPC from
    associating the VPC with the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If
    the VPC is already associated with the hosted zone,
    DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization won't disassociate the VPC from the hosted
    zone. If you want to delete an existing association, use
    DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone.
