    Retrieves a vector data tile from the map resource. Map tiles are used by
    clients to render a map. they're addressed using a grid arrangement with an
    X coordinate, Y coordinate, and Z (zoom) level.  The origin (0, 0) is the
    top left of the map. Increasing the zoom level by 1 doubles both the X and Y
    dimensions, so a tile containing data for the entire world at (0/0/0) will
    be split into 4 tiles at zoom 1 (1/0/0, 1/0/1, 1/1/0, 1/1/1).
