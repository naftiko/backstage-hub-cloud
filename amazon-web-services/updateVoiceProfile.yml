    Updates the specified voice profile’s voice print and refreshes its
    expiration timestamp.  As a condition of using this feature, you acknowledge
    that the collection, use, storage, and retention of your caller’s biometric
    identifiers and biometric information (“biometric data”) in the form of a
    digital voiceprint requires the caller’s informed consent via a written
    release. Such consent is required under various state laws, including
    biometrics laws in Illinois, Texas, Washington and other state privacy laws.
    You must provide a written release to each caller through a process that
    clearly reflects each caller’s informed consent before using Amazon Chime
    SDK Voice Insights service, as required under the terms of your agreement
    with AWS governing your use of the service.
