    Creates a new schema in a development state. A schema can exist in three
    phases:    Development: This is a mutable phase of the schema. All new
    schemas are in the development phase. Once the schema is finalized, it can
    be published.    Published: Published schemas are immutable and have a
    version associated with them.    Applied: Applied schemas are mutable in a
    way that allows you to add new schema facets. You can also add new,
    nonrequired attributes to existing schema facets. You can apply only
    published schemas to directories.
