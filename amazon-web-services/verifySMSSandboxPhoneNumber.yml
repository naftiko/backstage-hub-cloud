    Verifies a destination phone number with a one-time password (OTP) for the
    calling Amazon Web Services account. When you start using Amazon SNS to send
    SMS messages, your Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox. The
    SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for you to try Amazon SNS features
    without risking your reputation as an SMS sender. While your Amazon Web
    Services account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of
    Amazon SNS. However, you can send SMS messages only to verified destination
    phone numbers. For more information, including how to move out of the
    sandbox to send messages without restrictions, see SMS sandbox in the Amazon
    SNS Developer Guide.
