    Creates a place index resource in your Amazon Web Services account. Use a
    place index resource to geocode addresses and other text queries by using
    the SearchPlaceIndexForText operation, and reverse geocode coordinates by
    using the SearchPlaceIndexForPosition operation, and enable autosuggestions
    by using the SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions operation.  If your application
