  name: startcontactrecording
  description: >-
    Starts recording the contact:    If the API is called before the agent joins
    the call, recording starts when the agent joins the call.   If the API is
    called after the agent joins the call, recording starts at the time of the
    API call.   StartContactRecording is a one-time action. For example, if you
    use StopContactRecording to stop recording an ongoing call, you can't use
    StartContactRecording to restart it. For scenarios where the recording has
    started and you want to suspend and resume it, such as when collecting
    sensitive information (for example, a credit card number), use
    SuspendContactRecording and ResumeContactRecording. You can use this API to
    override the recording behavior configured in the Set recording behavior
    block. Only voice recordings are supported at this time.
