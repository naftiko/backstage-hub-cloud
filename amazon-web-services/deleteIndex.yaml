    Deletes the specified index and turns off Amazon Web Services Resource
    Explorer in the specified Amazon Web Services Region. When you delete an
    index, Resource Explorer stops discovering and indexing resources in that
    Region. Resource Explorer also deletes all views in that Region. These
    actions occur as asynchronous background tasks. You can check to see when
    the actions are complete by using the GetIndex operation and checking the
    Status response value.  If the index you delete is the aggregator index for
    the Amazon Web Services account, you must wait 24 hours before you can
    promote another local index to be the aggregator index for the account.
    Users can't perform account-wide searches using Resource Explorer until
    another aggregator index is configured.
