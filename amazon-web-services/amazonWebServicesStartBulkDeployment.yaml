    Deploys multiple groups in one operation. This action starts the bulk
    deployment of a specified set of group versions. Each group version
    deployment will be triggered with an adaptive rate that has a fixed upper
    limit. We recommend that you include an ''X-Amzn-Client-Token'' token in
    every ''StartBulkDeployment'' request. These requests are idempotent with
    respect to the token and the request parameters.
