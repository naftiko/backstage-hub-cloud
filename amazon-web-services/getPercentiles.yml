  description: >-
    Groups the aggregated values that match the query into percentile groupings.
    The default percentile groupings are: 1,5,25,50,75,95,99, although you can
    specify your own when you call GetPercentiles. This function returns a value
    for each percentile group specified (or the default percentile groupings).
    The percentile group "1" contains the aggregated field value that occurs in
    approximately one percent of the values that match the query. The percentile
    group "5" contains the aggregated field value that occurs in approximately
    five percent of the values that match the query, and so on. The result is an
    approximation, the more values that match the query, the more accurate the
    percentile values. Requires permission to access the GetPercentiles action.
