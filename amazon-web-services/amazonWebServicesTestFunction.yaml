    Tests a CloudFront function. To test a function, you provide an event object
    that represents an HTTP request or response that your CloudFront
    distribution could receive in production. CloudFront runs the function,
    passing it the event object that you provided, and returns the function's
    result (the modified event object) in the response. The response also
    contains function logs and error messages, if any exist. For more
    information about testing functions, see Testing functions in the Amazon
    CloudFront Developer Guide. To test a function, you provide the function's
    name and version (ETag value) along with the event object. To get the
    function's name and version, you can use ListFunctions and DescribeFunction.
