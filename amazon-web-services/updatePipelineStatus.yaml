    The UpdatePipelineStatus operation pauses or reactivates a pipeline, so that
    the pipeline stops or restarts the processing of jobs. Changing the pipeline
    status is useful if you want to cancel one or more jobs. You can't cancel
    jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started processing them; if you pause the
    pipeline to which you submitted the jobs, you have more time to get the job
    IDs for the jobs that you want to cancel, and to send a CancelJob request.
