    Creates a new Amazon EBS snapshot. The new snapshot enters the pending state
    after the request completes.  After creating the snapshot, use 
    PutSnapshotBlock to write blocks of data to the snapshot.  You should always
    retry requests that receive server (5xx) error responses, and
    ThrottlingException and RequestThrottledException client error responses.
    For more information see Error retries in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
    User Guide.
