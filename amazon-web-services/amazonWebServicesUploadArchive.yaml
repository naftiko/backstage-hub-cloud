  description: >-
    This operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation,
    and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon S3
    Glacier returns the archive ID in the x-amz-archive-id header of the
    response.  You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3
    Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID
    returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides
    saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to
    allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive
    description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external
    index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also
    get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more
    information, see InitiateJob.  You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the
    data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash,
    see Computing Checksums.  You can optionally specify an archive description
    of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive
    description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory.
    For more information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the
    description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique.
    You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. 
    Archives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the
    archive or its description. An AWS account has full permission to perform
    all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit
    permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access
    Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual
    information and underlying REST API, see Uploading an Archive in Amazon
    Glacier and Upload Archive in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.
