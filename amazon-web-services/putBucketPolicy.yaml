  description: ' This action puts a bucket policy to an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. To put a policy on an S3 bucket, see PutBucketPolicy in the Amazon S3 API Reference.   Applies an Amazon S3 bucket policy to an Outposts bucket. For more information, see Using Amazon S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Outposts bucket, the calling identity must have the PutBucketPolicy permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner''s account in order to use this action. If you don''t have PutBucketPolicy permissions, Amazon S3 returns a 403 Access Denied error. If you have the correct permissions, but you''re not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner''s account, Amazon S3 returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error.   As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies the root user the ability to perform this action.   For more information about bucket policies, see Using Bucket Policies and User Policies. All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section.
