    Searches for resources and displays details about all resources that match
    the specified criteria. You must specify a query string. All search queries
    must use a view. If you don't explicitly specify a view, then Amazon Web
    Services Resource Explorer uses the default view for the Amazon Web Services
    Region in which you call this operation. The results are the logical
    intersection of the results that match both the QueryString parameter
    supplied to this operation and the SearchFilter parameter attached to the
    view. For the complete syntax supported by the QueryString parameter, see
    Search query syntax reference for Resource Explorer. If your search results
    are empty, or are missing results that you think should be there, see
    Troubleshooting Resource Explorer search.
