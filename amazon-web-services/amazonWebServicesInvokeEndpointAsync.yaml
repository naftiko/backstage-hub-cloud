  description: >-
    After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting
    services, your client applications use this API to get inferences from the
    model hosted at the specified endpoint in an asynchronous manner. Inference
    requests sent to this API are enqueued for asynchronous processing. The
    processing of the inference request may or may not complete before you
    receive a response from this API. The response from this API will not
    contain the result of the inference request but contain information about
    where you can locate it. Amazon SageMaker strips all POST headers except
    those supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers.
    You should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in
    the request syntax.  Calls to InvokeEndpointAsync are authenticated by using
    Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For information, see Authenticating
    Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3 API
    Reference.
