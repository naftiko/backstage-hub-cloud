  name: Uploadsigningcertificate
  description: >-
    Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the specified
    IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use certificates
    to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key. When
    you upload the certificate, its default status is Active. For information
    about when you would use an X.509 signing certificate, see Managing server
    certificates in IAM in the IAM User Guide. If the UserName is not specified,
    the IAM user name is determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services
    access key ID used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys
    under the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this
    operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even
    if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.  Because the
    body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use POST rather than
    GET when calling UploadSigningCertificate. For information about setting up
    signatures and authorization through the API, see Signing Amazon Web
    Services API requests in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For
    general information about using the Query API with IAM, see Making query
    requests in the IAM User Guide.
