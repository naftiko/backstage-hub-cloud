    Lists active Gremlin queries. See Gremlin query status API for details about
    the output. When invoking this operation in a Neptune cluster that has IAM
    authentication enabled, the IAM user or role making the request must have a
    policy attached that allows the neptune-db:GetQueryStatus IAM action in that
    cluster. Note that the neptune-db:QueryLanguage:Gremlin IAM condition key
    can be used in the policy document to restrict the use of Gremlin queries
    (see Condition keys available in Neptune IAM data-access policy statements).
