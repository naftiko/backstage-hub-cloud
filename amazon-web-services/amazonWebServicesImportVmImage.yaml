    When you export your virtual machine (VM) from its virtualization
    environment, that process creates a set of one or more disk container files
    that act as snapshots of your VM’s environment, settings, and data. The
    Amazon EC2 API ImportImage action uses those files to import your VM and
    create an AMI. To import using the CLI command, see import-image  You can
    reference the task ID from the VM import to pull in the AMI that the import
    created as the base image for your Image Builder recipe.
