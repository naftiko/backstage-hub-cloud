    Retrieves a list of metadata for individual user sessions with your bot. The
    startDateTime and endDateTime fields are required. These fields define a
    time range for which you want to retrieve results. Of the optional fields,
    you can organize the results in the following ways:   Use the filters field
    to filter the results and the sortBy field to specify the values by which to
    sort the results.   Use the maxResults field to limit the number of results
    to return in a single response and the nextToken field to return the next
    batch of results if the response does not return the full set of results.
