    Repairs the IAM Identity Center configuration for a given studio. If the
    studio has a valid IAM Identity Center configuration currently associated
    with it, this operation will fail with a validation error. If the studio
    does not have a valid IAM Identity Center configuration currently associated
    with it, then a new IAM Identity Center application is created for the
    studio and the studio is changed to the READY state. After the IAM Identity
    Center application is repaired, you must use the Amazon Nimble Studio
    console to add administrators and users to your studio.
