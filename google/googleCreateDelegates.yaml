    Adds a delegate with its verification status set directly to `accepted`,
    without sending any verification email. The delegate user must be a member
    of the same Google Workspace organization as the delegator user. Gmail
    imposes limitations on the number of delegates and delegators each user in a
    Google Workspace organization can have. These limits depend on your
    organization, but in general each user can have up to 25 delegates and up to
    10 delegators. Note that a delegate user must be referred to by their
    primary email address, and not an email alias. Also note that when a new
    delegate is created, there may be up to a one minute delay before the new
    delegate is available for use. This method is only available to service
    account clients that have been delegated domain-wide authority.
