    Updates language settings. If successful, the return object contains the
    `displayLanguage` that was saved for the user, which may differ from the
    value passed into the request. This is because the requested
    `displayLanguage` may not be directly supported by Gmail but have a close
    variant that is, and so the variant may be chosen and saved instead.
