  name: Append Values
  description: >-
    Appends values to a spreadsheet. The input range is used to search for
    existing data and find a "table" within that range. Values will be appended
    to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of the table.
    See the [guide](/sheets/api/guides/values#appending_values) and [sample
    code](/sheets/api/samples/writing#append_values) for specific details of how
    tables are detected and data is appended. The caller must specify the
    spreadsheet ID, range, and a valueInputOption. The `valueInputOption` only
    controls how the input data will be added to the sheet (column-wise or
    row-wise), it does not influence what cell the data starts being written to.
