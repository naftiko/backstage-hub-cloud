  description: >-
    Creates a custom "from" send-as alias. If an SMTP MSA is specified, Gmail
    will attempt to connect to the SMTP service to validate the configuration
    before creating the alias. If ownership verification is required for the
    alias, a message will be sent to the email address and the resource's
    verification status will be set to `pending`; otherwise, the resource will
    be created with verification status set to `accepted`. If a signature is
    provided, Gmail will sanitize the HTML before saving it with the alias. This
    method is only available to service account clients that have been delegated
    domain-wide authority.
