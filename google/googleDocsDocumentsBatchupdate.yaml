  description: >-
    Applies one or more updates to the document. Each request is validated
    before being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request
    will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give
    you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do not need
    to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of
    replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call
    batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information.
    The response would have two empty replies, the reply to the third request,
    and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing
    the document, the document might not exactly reflect your changes: your
    changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no
    collaborators, the document should reflect your changes. In any case, the
    updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically.
