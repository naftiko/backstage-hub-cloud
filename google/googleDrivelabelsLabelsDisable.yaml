    Disable a published Label. Disabling a Label will result in a new disabled
    published revision based on the current published revision. If there is a
    draft revision, a new disabled draft revision will be created based on the
    latest draft revision. Older draft revisions will be deleted. Once disabled,
    a label may be deleted with `DeleteLabel`.
