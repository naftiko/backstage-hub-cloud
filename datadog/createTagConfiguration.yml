    Create and define a list of queryable tag keys for an existing
    count/gauge/rate/distribution metric.Optionally, include percentile
    aggregations on any distribution metric. By setting `exclude_tags_mode`to
    true, the behavior is changed from an allow-list to a deny-list, and tags in
    the defined list arenot queryable. Can only be used with application keys of
    users with the `Manage Tags for Metrics`permission.
