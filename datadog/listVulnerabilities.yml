    Get a list of vulnerabilities.### PaginationPagination is enabled by default
    in both `vulnerabilities` and `assets`. The size of the page varies
    depending on the endpoint and cannot be modified. To automate the request of
    the next page, you can use the links section in the response.This endpoint
    will return paginated responses. The pages are stored in the links section
    of the response:```JSON{  "data": [...],  "meta": {...},  "links": {   
    "self": "https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities",    "first":
    "https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities?page[number]=1&page[token]=abc",   
    "last":
    "https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities?page[number]=43&page[token]=abc",   
    "next":
    "https://.../api/v2/security/vulnerabilities?page[number]=2&page[token]=abc" 
    }}```- `links.previous` is empty if the first page is requested.-
    `links.next` is empty if the last page is requested.####
    TokenVulnerabilities can be created, updated or deleted at any point in
    time.Upon the first request, a token is created to ensure consistency across
    subsequent paginated requests.A token is valid only for 24 hours.#### First
    requestWe consider a request to be the first request when there is no
    `page[token]` parameter.The response of this first request contains the
    newly created token in the `links` section.This token can then be used in
    the subsequent paginated requests.#### Subsequent requestsAny request
    containing valid `page[token]` and `page[number]` parameters will be
    considered a subsequent request.If the `token` is invalid, a `404` response
    will be returned.If the page `number` is invalid, a `400` response will be
    returned.### FilteringThe request can include some filter parameters to
    filter the data to be retrieved. The format of the filter parameters follows
    the [JSON:API format](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering):
    `filter[$prop_name]`, where `prop_name` is the property name in the entity
    being filtered by.All filters can include multiple values, where data will
    be filtered with an OR clause: `filter[title]=Title1,Title2` will filter all
    vulnerabilities where title is equal to `Title1` OR `Title2`.String filters
    are case sensitive.Boolean filters accept `true` or `false` as values.Number
    filters must include an operator as a second filter input:
    `filter[$prop_name][$operator]`. For example, for the vulnerabilities
    endpoint: `filter[cvss.base.score][lte]=8`.Available operators are: `eq`
    (==), `lt` () and `gte` (>=).### MetadataFollowing [JSON:API
    format](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta), object including
    non-standard meta-information.This endpoint includes the meta member in the
    response. For more details on each of the properties included in this
    section, check the endpoints response tables.```JSON{  "data": [...],
