    Send your logs to your Datadog platform over HTTP. Limits per HTTP request
    are:- Maximum content size per payload (uncompressed): 5MB- Maximum size for
    a single log: 1MB- Maximum array size if sending multiple logs in an array:
    1000 entriesAny log exceeding 1MB is accepted and truncated by Datadog:- For
    a single log request, the API truncates the log at 1MB and returns a 2xx.-
    For a multi-logs request, the API processes all logs, truncates only logs
    larger than 1MB, and returns a 2xx.Datadog recommends sending your logs
    compressed.Add the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the request when
    sending compressed logs.Log events can be submitted with a timestamp that is
    up to 18 hours in the past.The status codes answered by the HTTP API are:-
    202: Accepted: the request has been accepted for processing- 400: Bad
    request (likely an issue in the payload formatting)- 401: Unauthorized
    (likely a missing API Key)- 403: Permission issue (likely using an invalid
    API Key)- 408: Request Timeout, request should be retried after some time-
    413: Payload too large (batch is above 5MB uncompressed)- 429: Too Many
    Requests, request should be retried after some time- 500: Internal Server
    Error, the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
    fulfilling the request, request should be retried after some time- 503:
    Service Unavailable, the server is not ready to handle the request probably
    because it is overloaded, request should be retried after some time
