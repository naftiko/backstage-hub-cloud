  description: >-
    Create and define a list of queryable tag keys for an existing
    count/gauge/rate/distribution metric.Optionally, include percentile
    aggregations on any distribution metric or configure custom aggregationson
    any count, rate, or gauge metric. By setting `exclude_tags_mode` to true the
    behavior is changedfrom an allow-list to a deny-list, and tags in the
    defined list will not be queryable.Can only be used with application keys of
    users with the `Manage Tags for Metrics` permission.
