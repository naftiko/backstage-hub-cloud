              ### Attributes


              All findings are updated with the same attributes. The request body
              must include at least two attributes: `muted` and `reason`.

              The allowed reasons depend on whether the finding is being muted or
              unmuted:
                - To mute a finding: `PENDING_FIX`, `FALSE_POSITIVE`, `ACCEPTED_RISK`, `OTHER`.
                - To unmute a finding : `NO_PENDING_FIX`, `HUMAN_ERROR`, `NO_LONGER_ACCEPTED_RISK`, `OTHER`.

              ### Meta


              The request body must include a list of the finding IDs to be updated.
