  description: >-
    Adds an attachment to a piece of content. If the attachment already
    existsfor the content, then the attachment is updated (i.e. a new version of
    theattachment is created).Note, you must set a `X-Atlassian-Token: nocheck`
    header on the requestfor this method, otherwise it will be blocked. This
    protects against XSRFattacks, which is necessary as this method accepts
    multipart/form-data.The media type 'multipart/form-data' is defined in [RFC
    7578](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7578.txt).Most client libraries have
    classes that make it easier to implementmultipart posts, like the
    [MultipartEntityBuilder](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.1.x/current/httpclient5/apidocs/)Java
    class provided by Apache HTTP Components.Note, according to [RFC
    7578](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7578#section-4.5),in the case where the
    form data is text,the charset parameter for the "text/plain" Content-Type
    may be used toindicate the character encoding used in that part. In the case
    of thisAPI endpoint, the `comment` body parameter should be sent with
    `type=text/plain`and `charset=utf-8` values. This will force the charset to
    be UTF-8.Example: This curl command attaches a file ('example.txt') to a
    piece ofcontent (id='123') with a comment and `minorEdits`=true. If the
    'example.txt'file already exists, it will update it with a new version of
    the attachment.``` bashcurl -D- \  -u admin:admin \  -X PUT \  -H
