  description: >-
    Returns the key and value of a dashboard item property.A dashboard item
    enables an app to add user-specific information to a user dashboard.
    Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their
    dashboards. For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and
    customizing gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).When an app
    creates a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the dashboard
    item ID. The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item
    is configurable, the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to
    store the item's content or configuration details. For more information on
    working with dashboard items, see [ Building a dashboard item for a JIRA
