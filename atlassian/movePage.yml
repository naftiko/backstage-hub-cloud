  name: Move A Page To A New Location Relative To A Target Page
  description: >-
    Move a page to a new location relative to a target page:* `before` - move
    the page under the same parent as the target, before the target in the list
    of children* `after` - move the page under the same parent as the target,
    after the target in the list of children* `append` - move the page to be a
    child of the targetCaution: This API can move pages to the top level of a
    space. Top-level pages are difficult to find in the UIbecause they do not
    show up in the page tree display. To avoid this, never use `before` or
    `after` positionswhen the `targetId` is a top-level page.
