  name: Search Issue Ids Using Jql
  description: >-
    Searches for IDs of issues using
    [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/egORLQ).Use the
    [Search](#api-rest-api-3-search-post) endpoint if you need to fetch more
    than just issue IDs. The Search endpoint returns more information, but may
    take much longer to respond to requests. This is because it uses a different
    mechanism for ordering results than this endpoint and doesn't provide the
    total number of results for your query.This operation can be accessed
    anonymously.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Issues are included in
    the response where the user has: *  *Browse projects* [project
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project
    containing the issue. *  If [issue-level
    security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured,
    issue-level security permission to view the issue.
