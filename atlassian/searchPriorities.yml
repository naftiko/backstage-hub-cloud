    Returns a [paginated](#pagination) list of priorities. The list can contain
    all priorities or a subset determined by any combination of these criteria:
    *  a list of priority IDs. Any invalid priority IDs are ignored. *  a list
    of project IDs. Only priorities that are available in these projects will be
    returned. Any invalid project IDs are ignored. *  whether the field
    configuration is a default. This returns priorities from company-managed
    (classic) projects only, as there is no concept of default priorities in
    team-managed projects.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission
    to access Jira.
