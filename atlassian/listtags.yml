  description: >-
    Returns the tags in the repository.By default, results will be in the order
    the underlying source control system returns them and identical tothe
    ordering one sees when running "$ git tag --list". Note that this follows
    simplelexical ordering of the ref names.This can be undesirable as it does
    apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags
    aresorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].Sorting can
    be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to
    explicitly sort on ref name,Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and
    interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.
