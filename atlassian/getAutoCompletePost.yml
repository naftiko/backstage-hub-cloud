    the programmatic creation of JQL queries or the validation of queries built
    in a custom query builder.This operation can filter the custom fields
    returned by project. Invalid project IDs in `projectIds` are ignored. System
    fields are always returned.It can also return the collapsed field for custom

    with the same name and of the same field type. For example, the collapsed
    field `Component - Component[Dropdown]` enables dropdown fields `Component -
    cf[10061]` and `Component - cf[10062]` to be searched
