  name: List Branches And Tags
  description: >-
    Returns the branches and tags in the repository.By default, results will be
    in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical
    tothe ordering one sees when running "$ git show-ref". Note that this
    follows simplelexical ordering of the ref names.This can be undesirable as
    it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that refs
    aresorted ["branch1", "branch10", "branch2", "v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of
    ["branch1", "branch2","branch10", "v9", "v10", "v11"].Sorting can be changed
    using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort
    on ref name,Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical
    values as numbers instead of strings.
