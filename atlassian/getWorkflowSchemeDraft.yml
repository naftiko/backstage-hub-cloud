    workflow schemes allow changes to be made to the active workflow schemes:
    When an active workflow scheme is updated, a draft copy is created. The
    draft is modified, then the changes in the draft are copied back to the
    active workflow scheme. See [Configuring workflow
    schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/tohKLg) for more information. 
    Note that: *  Only active workflow schemes can have draft workflow schemes.
    *  An active workflow scheme can only have one draft workflow
    scheme.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
