  name: Compare Two Commit Diff Stats
  description: >-
    Produces a response in JSON format with a record for every pathmodified,
    including information on the type of the change and thenumber of lines added
    and removed.#### Single commit specIf the `spec` argument to this API is a
    single commit, the diff isproduced against the first parent of the specified
    commit.#### Two commit specTwo commits separated by `..` may be provided as
    the `spec`, e.g.,`3a8b42..9ff173`. When two commits are provided and the
    `topic` queryparameter is true, this API produces a 2-way three dot
    diff.This is the diff between source commit and the merge base of the
    sourcecommit and the destination commit. When the `topic` query param is
    false,a simple git-style diff is produced.The two commits are interpreted as
    follows:* First commit: the commit containing the changes we wish to
    preview* Second commit: the commit representing the state to which we want
    to  compare the first commit* **Note**: This is the opposite of the order
    used in `git diff`.
