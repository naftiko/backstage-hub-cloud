  name: Get Projects Using Notification Schemes Paginated
  description: >-
    Returns a [paginated](#pagination) mapping of project that have notification
    scheme assigned. You can provide either one or multiple notification scheme
    IDs or project IDs to filter by. If you don't provide any, this will return
    a list of all mappings. Note that only company-managed (classic) projects
    are supported. This is because team-managed projects don't have a concept of
    a default notification scheme. The mappings are ordered by
    projectId.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** Permission to access
    Jira.
