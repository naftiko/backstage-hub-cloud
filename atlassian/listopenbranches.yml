  name: List Open Branches
  description: >-
    Returns a list of all open branches within the specified repository.Results
    will be in the order the source control manager returns them.Branches
    support [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering)that
    can be used to search for specific branches. For instance, to findall
    branches that have "stab" in their name:```curl -s
    https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/aui/refs/branches -G
    --data-urlencode 'q=name ~ "stab"'```By default, results will be in the
    order the underlying source control system returns them and identical tothe
    ordering one sees when running "$ git branch --list". Note that this follows
    simplelexical ordering of the ref names.This can be undesirable as it does
    apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags
    aresorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].Sorting can
    be changed using the ?q= query parameter. When using ?q=name to explicitly
    sort on ref name,Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret
    numerical values as numbers instead of strings.
