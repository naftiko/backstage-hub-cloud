    roles](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/)
    are a flexible way to to associate users and groups with projects. In Jira
    Cloud, the list of project roles is shared globally with all projects, but
    each project can have a different set of actors associated with it (unlike
    groups, which have the same membership throughout all Jira
    applications).Project roles are used in [permission
    schemes](#api-rest-api-3-permissionscheme-get), [email notification
    schemes](#api-rest-api-3-notificationscheme-get), [issue security
    levels](#api-rest-api-3-issuesecurityschemes-get), [comment
    visibility](#api-rest-api-3-comment-list-post), and workflow conditions.####
    Members and actors ####In the Jira REST API, a member of a project role is
    called an *actor*. An *actor* is a group or user associated with a project
    role.Actors may be set as [default
    members](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/manage-project-roles/#Specifying-'default-members'-for-a-project-role)
    of the project role or set at the project level: *  Default actors: Users
    and groups that are assigned to the project role for all newly created
    projects. The default actors can be removed at the project level later if
    desired. *  Actors: Users and groups that are associated with a project role
    for a project, which may differ from the default actors. This enables you to
    assign a user to different roles in different
    projects.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
