  description: >-
    Returns a list of users that can be assigned to an issue. Use this operation
    to find the list of users who can be assigned to: *  a new issue, by
    providing the `projectKeyOrId`. *  an updated issue, by providing the
    `issueKey`. *  to an issue during a transition (workflow action), by
    providing the `issueKey` and the transition id in `actionDescriptorId`. You
    can obtain the IDs of an issue's valid transitions using the `transitions`
    option in the `expand` parameter of [ Get
    issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-get).In all these cases, you can
    pass an account ID to determine if a user can be assigned to an issue. The
    user is returned in the response if they can be assigned to the issue or
    issue transition.This operation takes the users in the range defined by
    `startAt` and `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only
    the users from that range that can be assigned the issue. This means the
    operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get
    all the users who can be assigned the issue, use [Get all
    users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
    code.Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
    preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is
    hidden. See the [Profile visibility
    overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
