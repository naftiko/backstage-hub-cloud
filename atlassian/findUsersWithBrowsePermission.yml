  name: Find Users With Browse Permission
  description: >-
    Returns a list of users who fulfill these criteria: *  their user attributes
    match a search string. *  they have permission to browse issues.Use this
    resource to find users who can browse: *  an issue, by providing the
    `issueKey`. *  any issue in a project, by providing the `projectKey`.This
    operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
    `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
    from that range that match the search string and have permission to browse
    issues. This means the operation usually returns fewer users than specified
    in `maxResults`. To get all the users who match the search string and have
    permission to browse issues, use [Get all
    users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
    code.Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
    preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is
    hidden. See the [Profile visibility
    overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
    for more details.This operation can be accessed
    anonymously.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and
    groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
    Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return
    empty search results.
