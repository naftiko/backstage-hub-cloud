  description: >-
    Returns the patch of the specified commit against its firstparent.Note that
    this resource is different in functionality from the `diff`resource.The
    differences between a diff and a patch are:* patches have a commit header
    with the username, message, etc* diffs support the optional
    `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter the  diff to just that one file diff
    (not supported for patches)* for a merge, the diff will show the diff
    between the merge commit and  its first parent (identical to how PRs work),
    while patch returns a  response containing separate patches for each commit
    on the second  parent's ancestry, up to the oldest common ancestor
    (identical to  its reachability).Note that the character encoding of the
    contents of the patch isunspecified as Git does not track this, making it
    hard forBitbucket to reliably determine this.
