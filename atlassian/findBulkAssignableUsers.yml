  name: Find Users Assignable To Projects
  description: >-
    Returns a list of users who can be assigned issues in one or more projects.
    The list may be restricted to users whose attributes match a string.This
    operation takes the users in the range defined by `startAt` and
    `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
    from that range that can be assigned issues in the projects. This means the
    operation usually returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get
    all the users who can be assigned issues in the projects, use [Get all
    users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get) and filter the records in your
    code.Privacy controls are applied to the response based on the users'
    preferences. This could mean, for example, that the user's email address is
    hidden. See the [Profile visibility
    overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
    for more details.This operation can be accessed
    anonymously.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** None.
