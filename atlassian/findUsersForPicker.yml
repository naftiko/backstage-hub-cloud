    Returns a list of users whose attributes match the query term. The returned
    object includes the `html` field where the matched query term is highlighted
    with the HTML strong tag. A list of account IDs can be provided to exclude
    users from the results.This operation takes the users in the range defined
    by `maxResults`, up to the thousandth user, and then returns only the users
    from that range that match the query term. This means the operation usually
    returns fewer users than specified in `maxResults`. To get all the users who
    match the query term, use [Get all users](#api-rest-api-3-users-search-get)
    and filter the records in your code.Privacy controls are applied to the
    response based on the users' preferences. This could mean, for example, that
    the user's email address is hidden. See the [Profile visibility
    overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/profile-visibility/)
    for more details.This operation can be accessed
    anonymously.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse users and
    groups* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).
    Anonymous calls and calls by users without the required permission return
    search results for an exact name match only.
