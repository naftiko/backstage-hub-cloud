    a plain text string. For example, `false`. An arbitrary preference can be
    created with the value containing up to 255 characters. In addition, the
    following keys define system preferences that can be set or created: * 
    *user.notifications.mimetype* The mime type used in notifications sent to
    the user. Defaults to `html`. *  *user.default.share.private* Whether new [
    filters](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/eQiiLQ) are set to private.
    Defaults to `true`. *  *user.keyboard.shortcuts.disabled* Whether keyboard
    shortcuts are disabled. Defaults to `false`. *  *user.autowatch.disabled*
    Whether the user automatically watches issues they create or add a comment
    to. By default, not set: the user takes the instance autowatch setting.Note
    that these keys are deprecated: *  *jira.user.locale* The locale of the
    user. By default, not set. The user takes the instance locale. * 
    *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default, not set. The
    user takes the instance timezone.These system preferences keys will be
    deprecated by 15/07/2024. You can still use these keys to create arbitrary
    preferences, but it will not have any impact on Notification behaviour. * 
    *user.notifiy.own.changes* Whether the user gets notified of their own
    changes. *  *user.notifications.watcher* Whether the user gets notified when
    they are watcher. *  *user.notifications.assignee* Whether the user gets
