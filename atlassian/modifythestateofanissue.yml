  name: Modify The State Of An Issue
  description: >-
    Makes a change to the specified issue.For example, to change an issue's
    state and assignee, create a newchange object that modifies these
    fields:```curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/site/master/issues/1234/changes
    \  -s -u evzijst -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  -d '{   
    "changes": {      "assignee_account_id": {        "new":
    "557058:c0b72ad0-1cb5-4018-9cdc-0cde8492c443"      },      "state": {       
    "new": 'resolved"      }    }    "message": {      "raw": "This is now
    resolved."    }  }'```The above example also includes a custom comment to go
    alongside thechange. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in
    the UI.The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects.
    Thisallows for immutable change log records, even after user
    accounts,milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get
    renamed ordeleted.The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id.
    When POSTing anew change and changing the assignee, the client should
    therefore usethe user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new`
    field.This call requires authentication. Private repositories or
    privateissue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an account
    thathas appropriate authorization.
