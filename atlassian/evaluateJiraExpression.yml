  description: >-
    Evaluates a Jira expression and returns its value.This resource can be used
    to test Jira expressions that you plan to use elsewhere, or to fetch data in
    a flexible way. Consult the [Jira expressions
    documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/)
    for more details.#### Context variables ####The following context variables
    are available to Jira expressions evaluated by this resource. Their presence
    depends on various factors; usually you need to manually request them in the
    context object sent in the payload, but some of them are added automatically
    under certain conditions. *  `user`
    ([User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)):
    The current user. Always available and equal to `null` if the request is
    anonymous. *  `app`
    ([App](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#app)):
    The [Connect
    app](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/index/#connect-apps)
    that made the request. Available only for authenticated requests made by
    Connect Apps (read more here: [Authentication for Connect
    apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/security-for-connect-apps/)).
    *  `issue`
    ([Issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)):
    The current issue. Available only when the issue is provided in the request
    context object. *  `issues`
    ([List](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#list)
    of
    [Issues](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)):
    A collection of issues matching a JQL query. Available only when JQL is
    provided in the request context object. *  `project`
    ([Project](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#project)):
    The current project. Available only when the project is provided in the
    request context object. *  `sprint`
    ([Sprint](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#sprint)):

    request context object. *  `board`
    ([Board](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#board)):
    The current board. Available only when the board is provided in the request
    context object. *  `serviceDesk`
    ([ServiceDesk](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#servicedesk)):
    The current service desk. Available only when the service desk is provided
    in the request context object. *  `customerRequest`
    ([CustomerRequest](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#customerrequest)):
    The current customer request. Available only when the customer request is
    provided in the request context object.Also, custom context variables can be
    passed in the request with their types. Those variables can be accessed by
    key in the Jira expression. These variable types are available for use in a
    custom context: *  `user`: A
    [user](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#user)
    specified as an Atlassian account ID. *  `issue`: An
    [issue](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions-type-reference#issue)
    specified by ID or key. All the fields of the issue object are available in
    the Jira expression. *  `json`: A JSON object containing custom content. * 
    `list`: A JSON list of `user`, `issue`, or `json` variable types.This
    operation can be accessed anonymously.**[Permissions](#permissions)
    required**: None. However, an expression may return different results for
    different users depending on their permissions. For example, different users
    may see different comments on the same issue.  Permission to access Jira
    Software is required to access Jira Software context variables (`board` and
    `sprint`) or fields (for example, `issue.sprint`).
