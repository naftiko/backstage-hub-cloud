    subtasks to a workflow step other than the default start step, and issue
    properties set.The content of each issue or subtask is defined using
    `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask
    are determined using the [ Get create issue
    metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These are the same fields
    that appear on the issues' create screens. Note that the `description`,
    `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text
    fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields
    (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format
    content.Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows: * 
    `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue
    metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue
    types). *  `parent` the must contain the ID or key of the parent
    issue.**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and
    *Create issues* [project
    permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project in
    which each issue or subtask is created.
