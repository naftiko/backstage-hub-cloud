    Sets the value of a dashboard item property. Use this resource in apps to
    store custom data against a dashboard item.A dashboard item enables an app
    to add user-specific information to a user dashboard. Dashboard items are
    exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their dashboards. For more
    information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing
    gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).When an app creates a
    dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the dashboard item ID. The
    callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item is
    configurable, the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to
    store the item's content or configuration details. For more information on
