    Identical to `UPDATE /snippets/encoded_id`, except that this endpointtakes
    an explicit commit revision. Only the snippet's "HEAD"/"tip"(most recent)
    version can be updated and requests on all other,older revisions fail by
    returning a 405 status.Usage of this endpoint over the unrestricted
    `/snippets/encoded_id`could be desired if the caller wants to be sure no
    concurrentmodifications have taken place between the moment of the
    UPDATErequest and the original GET.This can be considered a so-called
    "Compare And Swap", or CASoperation.Other than that, the two endpoints are
    identical in behavior.
