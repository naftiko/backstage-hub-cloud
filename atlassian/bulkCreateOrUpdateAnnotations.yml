  name: Bulk Create Or Update Annotations
  description: >-
    Bulk upload of annotations.Annotations are individual findings that have
    been identified as part of a report, for example, a line of code that
    represents a vulnerability. These annotations can be attached to a specific
    file and even a specific line in that file, however, that is optional.
    Annotations are not mandatory and a report can contain up to 1000
    annotations.Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON
    array and make sure each annotation has the external_id field set to a
    unique value. If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we
    recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for
    example, mySystem-annotation001. The external id can later be used to
    identify the report as an alternative to the generated
    [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid).
    You can upload up to 100 annotations per POST request.### Sample cURL
