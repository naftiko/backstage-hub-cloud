  name: Get A List Of Subusers Assigned To An Ip
  description: >-
    This operation returns a list of Subuser IDs that have been assigned the
    specified IP address. To retrieve more information about the returned
    Subusers, use the [Subusers
    API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/subusers-api/list-all-subusers).You
    can use the `after_key` and `limit` query parameters to iterate through
    paginated results. The maximum limit is 100, meaning you may retrieve up to
    100 Subusers per request. If the `after_key` in the API response is not
    null, there are more Subusers assigned to the IP address than those returned
    in the request. You can repeat the request with the non-null `after_key`
    value and the same limit to retrieve the next group of Subusers.
