  name: Update Address Whitelist Mail Settings
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to update your current email address whitelist
    settings.**You can select whether or not this setting should be enabled by
    assigning the `enabled` field a `true` or `false` value.Passing only the
    `enabled` field to this endpoint will not alter your current `list` of
    whitelist entries. However, any modifications to your `list` of entries will
    overwrite the entire list. For this reason, you must included all existing
    entries you wish to retain in your `list` in addition to any new entries you
    intend to add. To remove one or more `list` entries, pass a `list` with only
    the entries you wish to retain.You should not add generic domains such as
    `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com`  in your `list` because your emails will not
    honor recipients' unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of
    [CAN-SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could damage
    your sending reputation.The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify
    email addresses or domains for which mail should never be suppressed.For
    example, if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your
    recipients use `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the
    address whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces,
    blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other words, all
    bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if
    they were sent under normal sending conditions.
