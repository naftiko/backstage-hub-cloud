  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all of the authenticated domains that
    have been assigned to a specific subuser.**Authenticated domains can be
    associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This
    functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's domain. To
    associate an authenticated domain with a subuser, the parent account must
    first authenticate and validate the domain. The parent may then associate
    the authenticated domain via the subuser management tools.Note that if you
    used the [`/v3/whitelabel/domains/{domain_id}/subuser:add` endpoint](
    https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/domain-authentication/associate-an-authenticated-domain-with-a-subuser-multiple)
    to add multiple domains to the subuser, you can use the
    [`/v3/whitelabel/domains/subuser/all`
    endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/domain-authentication/list-the-authenticated-domain-associated-with-a-subuser-multiple)
    to list those associated domains.
