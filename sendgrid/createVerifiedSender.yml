  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to create a new Sender Identify**.Upon successful
    submission of a `POST` request to this endpoint, an identity will be
    created, and a verification email will be sent to the address assigned to
    the `from_email` field. You must complete the verification process using the
    sent email to fully verify the sender.If you need to resend the verification
    email, you can do so with the Resend Verified Sender Request,
    `/resend/{id}`, endpoint.If you need to authenticate a domain rather than a
    Single Sender, see the [Domain Authentication
    API](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/domain-authentication/authenticate-a-domain).
