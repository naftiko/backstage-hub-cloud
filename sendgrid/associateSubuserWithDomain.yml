  name: Associate An Authenticated Domain With A Given User.
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to associate a specific authenticated domain with
    a subuser.**Authenticated domains can be associated with (i.e. assigned to)
    subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send
    mail using their parent's domain. To associate an authenticated domain with
    a subuser, the parent account must first authenticate and validate the
    domain. The parent may then associate the authenticated domain via the
    subuser management tools.[You can associate more than one domain with a
    subuser using the `v3/whitelabel/domains/{domain_id}/subuser:add`
    endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/domain-authentication/associate-an-authenticated-domain-with-a-subuser-multiple).
