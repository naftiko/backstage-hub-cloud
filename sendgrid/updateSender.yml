  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to update an existing Sender.**Updates to
    `from.email` require re-verification. If your domain has been authenticated,
    a new Sender will auto verify on creation. Otherwise, an email will be sent
    to the `from.email`.Partial updates are allowed, but fields that are marked
    as "required" in the `POST` (create) endpoint must not be nil if that field
    is included in the `PATCH` request.
