  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to remove an email address from the global
    suppressions group.**Deleting a suppression group will remove the
    suppression, meaning email will once again be sent to the previously
    suppressed addresses. This should be avoided unless a recipient indicates
    they wish to receive email from you again. You can use our [bypass
    filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions)
    to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are
    required.
