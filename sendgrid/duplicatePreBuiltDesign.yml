  name: Duplicate Sendgrid Pre-built Design
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of the pre-built Twilio SendGrid
    designs**.Like duplicating one of your existing designs, you are not
    required to pass any data in the body of a request to this endpoint. If you
    choose to leave the `name` field blank, your duplicate will be assigned the
    name of the design it was copied from with the text "Duplicate: " prepended
    to it. This name change is only a convenience, as the duplicate design will
    be assigned a unique ID that differentiates it from your other designs. You
    can retrieve the IDs for Twilio SendGrid pre-built designs using the "List
    SendGrid Pre-built Designs" endpoint.You can modify your duplicate’s name at
    the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field when
    making the initial request.More on retrieving design IDs can be found above.
