                                Valid values are "worker_delay" and
                                "worker_delay_seconds" (the second value appears
                                only if "worker_delay" has a value of "delayed").

                                Valid values for the ID "worker_delay" are "OK" or
                                "Delayed". Valid values for the ID
                                "worker_delay_seconds" is the time of delay to
                                upload.
