    **This endpoint allows the [upsert](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsert)
    (insert or update) of up to 30,000 contacts, or 6MB of data, whichever is
    lower**.Because the creation and update of contacts is an asynchronous
    process, the response will not contain immediate feedback on the processing
    of your upserted contacts. Rather, it will contain an HTTP 202 response
    indicating the contacts are queued for processing or an HTTP 4XX error
    containing validation errors. Should you wish to get the resulting contact's
    ID or confirm that your contacts have been updated or added, you can use the
    [Get Contacts by Identifiers
    operation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/contacts/get-contacts-by-identifiers).Please
    note that custom fields need to have been already created if you wish to set
    their values for the contacts being upserted. To do this, please use the
    [Create Custom Field Definition
    endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/custom-fields/create-custom-field-definition).You
    will see a `job_id` in the response to your request. This can be used to
    check the status of your upsert job. To do so, please use the [Import
    Contacts Status
    endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/contacts/import-contacts-status).If
    the contact already exists in the system, any entries submitted via this
    endpoint will update the existing contact. In order to update a contact, all
    of its existing identifiers must be present. Any fields omitted from the
    request will remain as they were. A contact's ID cannot be used to update
    the contact.The email field will be changed to all lower-case. If a contact
    is added with an email that exists but contains capital letters, the
    existing contact with the all lower-case email will be updated.
