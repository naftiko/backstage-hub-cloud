    bounce occurs when an email message has been returned to the sender because
    the recipient's address is invalid. A hard bounce might occur because the
    domain name doesn't exist or because the recipient is unknown.A soft bounce
    occurs when an email message reaches the recipient's mail server but is
    bounced back undelivered before it actually reaches the recipient. A soft
