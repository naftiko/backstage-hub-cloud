    **This endpoint allows you to create a new design**.You can add a new design
    by passing data, including a string of HTML email content, to `/designs`.
    When creating designs from scratch, be aware of the styling constraints
    inherent to many email clients. For a list of best practices, see our guide
    to [Cross-Platform Email
    Design](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/cross-platform-html-design/).The
    Design Library can also convert your design’s HTML elements into drag and
    drop modules that are editable in the Designs Library user interface. For
    more, visit the [Design and Code Editor
    documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/editor/#drag--drop-markup).Because
    the `/designs` endpoint makes it easy to add designs, you can create a
    design with your preferred tooling or migrate designs you already own
    without relying on the Design Library UI.
