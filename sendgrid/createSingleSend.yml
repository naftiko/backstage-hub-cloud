    **This endpoint allows you to create a new Single Send.**Please note that if
    you are migrating from the previous version of Single Sends, you no longer
    need to pass a template ID with your request to this endpoint. Instead, you
    will pass all template data in the `email_config` object.This endpoint will
    create a draft of the Single Send but will not send it or schedule it to be
    sent. Any `send_at` property value set with this endpoint will prepopulate
    the Single Send's send date. However, the Single Send will remain an
    unscheduled draft until it's updated with the [**Schedule Single
    Send**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/single-sends/schedule-single-send)
    endpoint or SendGrid application UI.
