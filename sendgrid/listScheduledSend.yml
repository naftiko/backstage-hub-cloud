  name: Retrieve All Scheduled Sends
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all cancelled and paused scheduled
    send information.**This endpoint will return only the scheduled sends that
    are associated with a `batch_id`. If you have scheduled a send using the
    `/mail/send` endpoint and the `send_at` field but no `batch_id`, the send
    will be scheduled for delivery; however, it will not be returned by this
    endpoint. For this reason, you should assign a `batch_id` to any scheduled
    send you may need to pause or cancel in the future.
