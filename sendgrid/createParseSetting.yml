  name: Create A Parse Setting
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to create a new inbound parse setting.**Creating
    an Inbound Parse setting requires two pieces of information: a `url` and a
    `hostname`.The `hostname` must correspond to a domain authenticated by
    Twilio SendGrid on your account. If you need to complete domain
    authentication, you can use the [Twilio SendGrid
    App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) or the **Authenticate a
    Domain** endpoint. See [**How to Set Up Domain
    Authentication**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/)
    for instructions.Any email received by the `hostname` will be parsed when
    you complete this setup. You must also add a Twilio SendGrid MX record to
    this domain's DNS records. See [**Setting up the Inbound Parse
    Webhook**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/parsing-email/setting-up-the-inbound-parse-webhook/)
    for full instructions.The `url` represents a location where the parsed
    message data will be delivered. Twilio SendGrid will make an HTTP POST
    request to this `url` with the message data. The `url` must be publicly
    reachable, and your application must return a `200` status code to signal
    that the message data has been received.
