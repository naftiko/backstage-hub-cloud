    the [**Get an Event
    Webhook**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/get-an-event-webhook)
    and [**Update an Event
    Webhook**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/update-an-event-webhook)
    endpoints, which will operate on your oldest webhook by `created_date` when
    you don't provide an ID, this endpoint will return an error if you do not
    pass it an ID. This behavior prevents customers from unintentionally
    deleting a webhook. You can retrieve your webhooks' IDs using the [**Get All

    endpoint.### Enable or disable the webhookThis endpoint will permanently
    delete the webhook specified. If you instead want to disable a webhook, you
    can set the `enabled` property to `false` with the [**Update an Event
    Webhook**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/update-an-event-webhook)
    endpoint.
