  description: >-
    **This operation allows you to validate a mail batch ID.**If you provide a
    valid batch ID, this operation will return a `200` status code and the batch
    ID itself.If you provide an invalid batch ID, you will receive a `400` level
    status code and an error message.A batch ID does not need to be assigned to
    a send to be considered valid. A successful response means only that the
    batch ID has been created, but it does not indicate that the ID has been
    assigned to a send.
