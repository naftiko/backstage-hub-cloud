    Upload.
  description: >-
    **This endpoint returns a presigned URL and request headers. Use this
    information to upload a list of email addresses for verification.**Note that
    in a successful response the `content-type` header value matches the
    provided `file_type` parameter in the `PUT` request.Once you have an
    `upload_uri` and the `upload_headers`, you're ready to upload your email
    address list for verification. For the expected format of the email address
    list and a sample upload request, see the [Bulk Email Address Validation
    Overview
    page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/managing-contacts/email-address-validation/bulk-email-address-validation-overview).
