    **This endpoint allows you to update a Single Send using a Single Send
    ID.**You only need to pass the properties you want to update. Any blank or
    missing properties will remain unaltered.This endpoint will update a draft
    of the Single Send but will not send it or schedule it to be sent. Any
    `send_at` property value set with this endpoint will prepopulate the Single
    Send's send date. However, the Single Send will remain an unscheduled draft
    until it's updated with the [**Schedule Single
    Send**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/single-sends/schedule-single-send)
    endpoint or SendGrid application UI.
