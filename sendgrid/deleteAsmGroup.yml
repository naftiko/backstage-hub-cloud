  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to delete a suppression group.**If a recipient
    uses the "one-click unsubscribe" option on an email associated with a
    deleted group, that recipient will be added to the global suppression
    list.Deleting a suppression group will remove the suppression, meaning email
    will once again be sent to the previously suppressed addresses. This should
    be avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you
    again. You can use our [bypass
    filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions)
    to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are
    required.
