  name: Get Signed Event Webhook's Public Key
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the public key for a single Event
    Webhook by ID.**If you do not pass a webhook ID to this endpoint, it will
    return the public key for your oldest webhook by `created_date`. This means
    the default key returned by this endpoint when no ID is provided will be for
    the first webhook you created. This functionality allows customers who do
    not have multiple webhooks to use this endpoint to retrieve their only
    webhook's public key, even if they do not supply an ID. If you have multiple
    webhooks, you can retrieve their IDs using the [**Get All Event
    Webhooks**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/get-all-event-webhooks)
    endpoint.Once you have enabled signature verification for a webhook, you
    will need the public key provided to verify the signatures on requests
    coming from Twilio SendGrid. You can use the webhook ID to [enable or
    disable signature verification with the endpoint dedicated for that
    operation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/toggle-signature-verification-for-an-event-webhook).For
    more information about cryptographically signing the Event Webhook, see

    Features**](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook-security-features).
