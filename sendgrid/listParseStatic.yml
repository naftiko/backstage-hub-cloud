  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve the statistics for your Parse Webhook
    usage.**SendGrid's Inbound Parse Webhook allows you to parse the contents
    and attachments of incoming emails. The Parse API can then POST the parsed
    emails to a URL that you specify. The Inbound Parse Webhook cannot parse
    messages greater than 30MB in size, including all attachments.There are a
    number of pre-made integrations for the SendGrid Parse Webhook which make
    processing events easy. You can find these integrations in the [Library
    Index](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/sending-email/libraries#webhook-libraries).
