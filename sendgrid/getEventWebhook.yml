  name: Get The Settings For A Single Event Webhook.
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a single Event Webhook by ID.**If you
    do not pass a webhook ID to this endpoint, it will return your oldest
    webhook by `created_date`. This means the default webhook returned by this
    endpoint when no ID is provided will be the first one you created. This
    functionality allows customers who do not have multiple webhooks to use this
    endpoint to retrieve their only webhook, even if they do not supply an ID.
    If you have multiple webhooks, you can retrieve their IDs using the [**Get
    All Event
    Webhooks**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/get-all-event-webhooks)
    endpoint.### Event settingsYour webhook will be returned with all of its
    settings, which include the events that will be included in the POST request
    by the webhook and the URL where they will be sent. If an event type is
    marked as `true`, the event webhook will send information about that event
    type. See the [**Event Webhook
    Reference**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/event#delivery-events)
    for details about each event type.### Signature verificationThe `public_key`
    property will be returned only for webhooks with signature verification
    enabled.### OAuthYou may share one OAuth configuration across all your
    webhooks or create unique credentials for each. The OAuth properties will be
    returned only for webhooks with OAuth configured.
