  name: Update A Single Event Webhook By Id.
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to update a single Event Webhook by ID.**If you
    do not pass a webhook ID to this endpoint, it will update and return your
    oldest webhook by `created_date`. This means the default webhook updated by
    this endpoint when no ID is provided will be the first one you created. This
    functionality allows customers who do not have multiple webhooks to use this
    endpoint to update their only webhook, even if they do not supply an ID. If
    you have multiple webhooks, you can retrieve their IDs using the [**Get All
    Event
    Webhooks**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/get-all-event-webhooks)
    endpoint.### Enable or disable the webhookYou can set the `enabled` property
    to `true` to enable the webhook or `false` to disable it. Disabling a
    webhook will not delete it from your account, but it will prevent the
    webhook from sending events to your designated URL.### URLA webhook's URL is
    the endpoint where you want the webhook to send POST requests containing
    event data. No more than one webhook may be configured to send to the same
    URL. SendGrid will return an error if you attempt to set a URL for a webhook
    that is already in use by the user on another webhook.### Event settingsIf
    an event type is marked as `true`, the event webhook will send information
    about that event type. See the [**Event Webhook
    Reference**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/event#delivery-events)
    for details about each event type.### Webhook identifiersYou may assign an
    optional friendly name to each of your webhooks. The friendly name is for
    convenience only and should not be used to programmatically differentiate
    your webhooks because it does not need to be unique.### OAuthYou can
    configure OAuth for your webhook by passing the required values to this
    endpoint in the `oauth_client_id`, `oauth_client_secret`, and
    `oauth_token_url` properties. To disable OAuth, pass an empty string to this
    endpoint for each of the OAuth properties. You may share one OAuth
    configuration across all your webhooks or create unique credentials for
    each. See our [webhook security
    documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook-security-features#oauth-20)
    for more detailed information about OAuth and the Event Webhook.###
    Signature verificationEnabling signature verification for your webhook is a
    separate process and cannot be done with this endpoint. You can use the
    webhook ID to [enable or disable signature verification with the endpoint
    dedicated for that
    operation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/webhooks/toggle-signature-verification-for-an-event-webhook).
