  name: Update Enforced Tls Settings
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to update your Enforced TLS settings.**To require
    TLS from recipients, set `require_tls` to `true`. If either `require_tls` or
    `require_valid_cert` is set to `true`, the recipient must support TLS 1.1 or
    higher or have a valid certificate. If these conditions are not met, Twilio
    SendGrid will drop the message and send a block event with “TLS required but
    not supported” as the description.
