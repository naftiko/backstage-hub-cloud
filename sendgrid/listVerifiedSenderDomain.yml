  description: >-
    **This endpoint returns a list of domains known to implement DMARC and
    categorizes them by failure type — hard failure or soft failure**.Domains
    listed as hard failures will not deliver mail when used as a [Sender
    Identity](https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/sender-identity/)
    due to the domain's DMARC policy settings.For example, using a `yahoo.com`
    email address as a Sender Identity will likely result in the rejection of
    your mail. For more information about DMARC, see [Everything about
    DMARC](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/dmarc/).
