  name: Disassociate An Authenticated Domain From A Given User.
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to disassociate a specific authenticated domain
    from a subuser.**Authenticated domains can be associated with (i.e. assigned
    to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to
    send mail using their parent's domain. To associate an authenticated domain
    with a subuser, the parent account must first authenticate and validate the
    domain. The parent may then associate the authenticated domain via the
    subuser management tools.Note that if you used the
    [`/v3/whitelabel/domains/{domain_id}/subuser:add`
    endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/domain-authentication/associate-an-authenticated-domain-with-a-subuser-multiple)
    to add multiple domains to the subuser, you should use the
    [`/v3/whitelabel/domains/{domain_id}/subuser`
    endpoint](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/domain-authentication/disassociate-an-authenticated-domain-from-a-subuser-multiple)
    to disassociate those domains.
