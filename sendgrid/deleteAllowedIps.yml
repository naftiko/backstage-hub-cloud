  name: Remove One Or More Ips From The Allow List
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IP addresses from your list
    of allowed addresses.**To remove one or more IP addresses, pass this
    endpoint an array containing the ID(s) associated with the IP(s) you intend
    to remove. You can retrieve the IDs associated with your allowed IP
    addresses using the "Retrieve a list of currently allowed IPs" endpoint.It
    is possible to remove your own IP address, which will block access to your
    account. You will need to submit a [support
