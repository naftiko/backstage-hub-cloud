  name: Retrieve Address Whitelist Mail Settings
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current email address whitelist
    settings.**The Address Whitelist setting allows you to specify email
    addresses or domains for which mail should never be suppressed.For example,
    if you own the domain `example.com`, and one or more of your recipients use
    `email@example.com` addresses, placing `example.com` in the address
    whitelist setting instructs Twilio SendGrid to ignore all bounces, blocks,
    and unsubscribes logged for that domain. In other words, all bounces,
    blocks, and unsubscribes will still be sent to `example.com` as if they were
    sent under normal sending conditions.
