  name: Create A Batch Id.
  description: >-
    **This operation allows you to generate a new mail batch ID.**Once a batch
    ID is created, you can associate it with a mail send by passingit in the
    request body of the [Mail Send
    operation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/mail-send).This
    makes it possible to group multiple requests to the Mail Send operationby
    assigning them the same batch ID.A batch ID that's associated with a mail
    send can be used to access and modify the associated send. For example, you
    can pause or cancel a send using its batch ID. See the [Scheduled Sends
    API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/api-reference/cancel-scheduled-sends)
    for more information about pausing and cancelling a mail send.
