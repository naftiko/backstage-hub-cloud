  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to duplicate an existing Single Send using its
    Single Send ID.**Duplicating a Single Send is useful when you want to create
    a Single Send but don't want to start from scratch. Once duplicated, you can
    update or edit the Single Send by making a PATCH request to the
    `/marketing/singlesends/{id}` endpoint. If you leave the `name` field blank,
    your duplicate will be assigned the name of the Single Send it was copied
    from with the text “Copy of ” prepended to it. The `name` field length is
    limited to 100 characters, so the end of the new Single Send name, including
    “Copy of ”, will be trimmed if the name exceeds this limit.
