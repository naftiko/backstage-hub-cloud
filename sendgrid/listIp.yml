  name: Retrieve All Ip Addresses
  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated list of all assigned and
    unassigned IPs.**Response includes warm up status, pools, assigned subusers,
    and reverse DNS info. The start_date field corresponds to when warmup
    started for that IP.A single IP address or a range of IP addresses may be
    dedicated to an account in order to send email for multiple domains. The
    reputation of this IP is determined by the aggregate performance of all
    email traffic sent from it.You can use the `limit` query parameter to set
    the page size. If your list contains more items than the page size permits,
    you can make multiple requests. Use the `offset` query parameter to control
    the position in the list from which to start retrieving additional items.
