    **This endpoint allows you to duplicate one of your existing
    designs**.Modifying an existing design is often the easiest way to create
    something new.You are not required to pass any data in the body of a request
    to this endpoint. If you choose to leave the `name` field blank, your
    duplicate will be assigned the name of the design it was copied from with
    the text "Duplicate: " prepended to it. This name change is only a
    convenience, as the duplicate will be assigned a unique ID that
    differentiates it from your other designs.You can modify your duplicate’s
    name at the time of creation by passing an updated value to the `name` field
    when making the initial request.More on retrieving design IDs can be found
    below.
