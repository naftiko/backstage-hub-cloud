    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current Enforced TLS
    settings.**The Enforced TLS settings specify whether or not the recipient is
    required to support TLS or have a valid certificate.If either `require_tls`
    or `require_valid_cert` is set to `true`, the recipient must support TLS 1.1
    or higher or have a valid certificate. If these conditions are not met,
    Twilio SendGrid will drop the message and send a block event with “TLS
    required but not supported” as the description.
