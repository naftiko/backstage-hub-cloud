    **This endpoint allows you to schedule a specific date and time for your
    campaign to be sent.**If you have the flexibility, it's better to schedule
    mail for off-peak times. Most emails are scheduled and sent at the top of
    the hour or half hour. Scheduling email to avoid those times (for example,
    scheduling at 10:53) can result in lower deferral rates because it won't be
    going through our servers at the same times as everyone else's mail.
