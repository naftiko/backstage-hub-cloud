    **This endpoint allows you to retrieve all the Sender Identities associated
    with an account.**This endpoint will return both verified and unverified
    senders.You can limit the number of results returned using the `limit`,
    `lastSeenID`, and `id` query string parameters.* `limit` allows you to
    specify an exact number of Sender Identities to return.* `lastSeenID` will
    return senders with an ID number occuring after the passed in ID. In other
    words, the `lastSeenID` provides a starting point from which SendGrid will
    iterate to find Sender Identities associated with your account.* `id` will
    return information about only the Sender Identity passed in the request.
