  description: >-
    **This endpoint allows you to update your current Forward Spam mail
    settings.**Enabling the Forward Spam setting allows you to specify `email`
    addresses to which spam reports will be forwarded. You can set multiple
    addresses by passing this endpoint a comma separated list of emails in a
    single string.```{  "email": "address1@example.com, address2@exapmle.com", 
    "enabled": true}```The Forward Spam setting may also be used to receive
    emails sent to `abuse@` and `postmaster@` role addresses if you have
    authenticated your domain.For example, if you authenticated `example.com` as
    your root domain and set a custom return path of `sub` for that domain, you
    could turn on Forward Spam, and any emails sent to `abuse@sub.example.com`
    or `postmaster@sub.example.com` would be forwarded to the email address you
    entered in the `email` field.You can authenticate your domain using the
    "Authenticate a domain" endpoint or in the [Sender Authentication section of
    the Twilio SendGrid App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth). You
    can also configure the Forward Spam mail settings in the [Mail Settings
    section of the Twilio SendGrid
    App](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/mail_settings).
