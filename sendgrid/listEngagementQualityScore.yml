  description: >-
    **This operation allows you to retrieve your SendGrid Engagement Quality
    (SEQ) scores for a specified date range**.A successful request with this API
    operation will return either a `200` or `202` response.### 202This operation
    returns a `202` response when SendGrid does not yet have scores available
    for the specified date range. Scores are calculated asynchronously from
    requests to this endpoint. This means a score may be available for the
    specified date at a later time, but a score is not available at the time of
    your API request.### 200A 200 response will include all available scores
    beginning on the `from` and ending on the `to` dates specified. The `score`
    and `metrics` properties will be omitted from the response for any days in
    which the user is not eligible to receive a score.The `score` property
    represents a user's overall engagement quality. The `metrics` property
    provides additional scores for the input categories that contribute to that
    overall score. All scores range from `1` to `5` with a higher number
    representing better engagement quality.See [**SendGrid Engagement Quality
