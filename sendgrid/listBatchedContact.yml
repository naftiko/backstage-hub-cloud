  name: Get Batched Contacts By Ids
  description: >-
    **This endpoint is used to retrieve a set of contacts identified by their
    IDs.**This can be more efficient endpoint to get contacts than making a
    series of individual `GET` requests to the "Get a Contact by ID"
    endpoint.You can supply up to 100 IDs. Pass them into the `ids` field in
    your request body as an array or one or more strings.Twilio SendGrid
    recommends exporting your contacts regularly as a backup to avoid issues or
    lost data.
