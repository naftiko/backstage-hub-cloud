    **This endpoint allows you to delete your spam reports.**Deleting a spam
    report will remove the suppression, meaning email will once again be sent to
    the previously suppressed address. This should be avoided unless a recipient
    indicates they wish to receive email from you again. You can use our [bypass
    filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions)
    to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are
    required.There are two options for deleting spam reports: 1. You can delete
    all spam reports by setting the `delete_all` field to `true` in the request
    body.2. You can delete a list of select spam reports by specifying the email
    addresses in the `emails` array of the request body.
