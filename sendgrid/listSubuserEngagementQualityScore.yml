  name: Get Subusers' Engagement Quality Scores
  description: >-
    **This operation allows you to retrieve SendGrid Engagement Quality (SEQ)
    scores for your Subusers or customer accounts for a specific date.**A
    successful request with this API operation will return either a `200` or
    `202` response.### 202This operation returns a `202` response when SendGrid
    does not yet have scores available for the specified date range. Scores are
    calculated asynchronously from requests to this endpoint. This means a score
    may be available for the specified date at a later time, but a score is not
    available at the time of your API request.### 200A `200` response will
    include scores for all Subusers or customer accounts belonging to the
    requesting parent or reseller account. The `score` and `metrics` properties
    will be omitted from the response if a Subuser or customer account is not
    eligible to receive a score for the specified date.The `score` property
    represents a Subuser or customer account's overall engagement quality. The
    `metrics` property provides additional scores for the input categories that
    contribute to that overall score. All scores range from `1` to `5` with a
    higher number representing better engagement quality.See [**SendGrid
