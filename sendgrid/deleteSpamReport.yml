    **This endpoint allows you to delete a specific spam report by email
    address.**Deleting a spam report will remove the suppression, meaning email
    will once again be sent to the previously suppressed address. This should be
    avoided unless a recipient indicates they wish to receive email from you
    again. You can use our [bypass
    filters](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/index-suppressions/#bypass-suppressions)
    to deliver messages to otherwise suppressed addresses when exceptions are
    required.
