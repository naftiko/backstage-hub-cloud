  description: >-
    **Use this endpoint to retrieve details of all current exported jobs**.It
    will return an array of objects, each of which records an export job in
    flight or recently completed. Each object's `export_type` field will tell
    you which kind of export it is and its `status` field will indicate what
    stage of processing it has reached. Exports which are `ready` will be
    accompanied by a `urls` field which lists the URLs of the export's
    downloadable files — there will be more than one if you specified a maximum
    file size in your initial export request.Use this endpoint if you have
    exports in flight but do not know their IDs, which are required for the
    "Export Recipients Status" endpoint.
