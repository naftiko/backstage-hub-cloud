    **Use this endpoint to export lists or segments of contacts**.If you would
    just like to have a link to the exported list sent to your email set the
    `notifications.email` option to `true` in the `POST` payload.If you would
    like to download the list, take the `id` that is returned and use the
    "Export Contacts Status" endpoint to get the `urls`. Once you have the list
    of URLs, make a `GET` request to each URL provided to download your CSV
    file(s).You specify the segments and or/contact lists you wish to export by
    providing the relevant IDs in, respectively, the `segment_ids` and
    `list_ids` fields in the request body.The lists will be provided in either
    JSON or CSV files. To specify which of these you would required, set the
    request body `file_type` field to `json` or `csv`.You can also specify a
    maximum file size (in MB). If the export file is larger than this, it will
    be split into multiple files.
