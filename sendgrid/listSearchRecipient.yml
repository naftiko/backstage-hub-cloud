    **This endpoint allows you to perform a search on all of your Marketing
    Campaigns recipients.**field_name:* is a variable that is substituted for
    your actual custom field name from your recipient.* Text fields must be
    url-encoded. Date fields are searchable only by unix timestamp (e.g.
    2/2/2015 becomes 1422835200)* If field_name is a 'reserved' date field, such
    as created_at or updated_at, the system will internally convertyour epoch
    time to a date range encompassing the entire day. For example, an epoch time
    of 1422835600 converts toMon, 02 Feb 2015 00:06:40 GMT, but internally the
    system will search from Mon, 02 Feb 2015 00:00:00 GMT throughMon, 02 Feb
    2015 23:59:59 GMT.
