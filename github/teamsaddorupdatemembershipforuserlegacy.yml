    **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be
    removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use
    the new [Add or update team membership for a
    user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/teams/members#add-or-update-team-membership-for-a-user)
    endpoint.Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
    Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
    products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
    in the GitHub Help documentation.If the user is already a member of the
    team's organization, this endpoint will add the user to the team. To add a
    membership between an organization member and a team, the authenticated user
    must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.**Note:** When you have
    team synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity
    provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for
    making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group
    membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team
    membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and
    removes team members in an organization. For more information, see
    "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise
    Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."If
    the user is unaffiliated with the team's organization, this endpoint will
    send an invitation to the user via email. This newly-created membership will
    be in the "pending" state until the user accepts the invitation, at which
    point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will
    be added as a member of the team. To add a membership between an
    unaffiliated user and a team, the authenticated user must be an organization
    owner.If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update
    the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team
    member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team
    maintainer.
