  name: Get Github Advanced Security Active Committers For An Organization
  description: >-
    Gets the GitHub Advanced Security active committers for an organization per
    repository.Each distinct user login across all repositories is counted as a
    single Advanced Security seat, so the `total_advanced_security_committers`
    is not the sum of advanced_security_committers for each repository.If this
    organization defers to an enterprise for billing, the
    `total_advanced_security_committers` returned from the organization API may
    include some users that are in more than one organization, so they will only
    consume a single Advanced Security seat at the enterprise level.The total
    number of repositories with committer information is tracked by the
    `total_count` field.
