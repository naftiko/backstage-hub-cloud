  name: Set Allowed Actions For A Repository
  description: >-
    Sets the actions that are allowed in a repository. To use this endpoint, the
    repository permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured to
    `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub Actions permissions for a
    repository](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-a-repository)."If the
    repository belongs to an organization or enterprise that has `selected`
    actions set at the organization or enterprise levels, then you cannot
    override any of the allowed actions settings.To use the `patterns_allowed`
    setting for private repositories, the repository must belong to an
    enterprise. If the repository does not belong to an enterprise, then the
    `patterns_allowed` setting only applies to public repositories.OAuth app
    tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use
    this endpoint.
