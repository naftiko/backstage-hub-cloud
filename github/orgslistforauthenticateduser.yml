    List organizations for the authenticated user.For OAuth app tokens and
    personal access tokens (classic), this endpoint only lists organizations
    that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can
    list teams with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your organization
    membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least
    `user` or `read:org` scope for OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens
    (classic). Requests with insufficient scope will receive a `403 Forbidden`
    response.
