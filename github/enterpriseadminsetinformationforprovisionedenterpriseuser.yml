  name: Set Scim Information For A Provisioned Enterprise User
  description: >-
    **Note:** The SCIM API endpoints for enterprise accounts are currently in
    *private* beta and are subject to change.Replaces an existing provisioned
    user's information.You must provide all the information required for the
    user as if you were provisioning them for the first time. Any existing user
    information that you don't provide will be removed. If you want to only
    update a specific attribute, use the [Update an attribute for a SCIM
    user](#update-an-attribute-for-a-scim-enterprise-user) endpoint
    instead.**Warning:** Setting `active: false` will suspend a user and
    obfuscate the user handle and user email. Since the implementation is a
    generic SCIM implementation and does not differentiate yet between different
    IdP providers, for Okta, the user GDPR data will not be purged and the
    credentials will not be removed.
