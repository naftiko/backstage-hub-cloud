  name: Set A Thread Subscription
  description: >-
    If you are watching a repository, you receive notifications for all threads
    by default. Use this endpoint to ignore future notifications for threads
    until you comment on the thread or get an **@mention**.You can also use this
    endpoint to subscribe to threads that you are currently not receiving
    notifications for or to subscribed to threads that you have previously
    ignored.Unsubscribing from a conversation in a repository that you are not
    watching is functionally equivalent to the [Delete a thread
    subscription](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/activity/notifications#delete-a-thread-subscription)
    endpoint.
