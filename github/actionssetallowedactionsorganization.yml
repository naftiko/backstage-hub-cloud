  name: Set Allowed Actions For An Organization
  description: >-
    Sets the actions that are allowed in an organization. To use this endpoint,
    the organization permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured
    to `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub Actions permissions
    for an
    organization](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-an-organization)."If the
    organization belongs to an enterprise that has `selected` actions set at the
    enterprise level, then you cannot override any of the enterprise's allowed
    actions settings.To use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private
    repositories, the organization must belong to an enterprise. If the
    organization does not belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed`
    setting only applies to public repositories in the organization.OAuth app
    tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to
    use this endpoint.
