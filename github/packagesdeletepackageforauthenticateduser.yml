  name: Delete A Package For The Authenticated User
  description: >-
    Deletes a package owned by the authenticated user. You cannot delete a
    public package if any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads.
    In this scenario, contact GitHub support for further assistance.OAuth app
    tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and
    `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs
    to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped
    permissions, `repo` scope is also required. For the list these registries,
    see "[About permissions for GitHub
    Packages](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
