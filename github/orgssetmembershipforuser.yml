  description: >-
    Only authenticated organization owners can add a member to the organization
    or update the member's role.*   If the authenticated user is _adding_ a
    member to the organization, the invited user will receive an email inviting
    them to the organization. The user's [membership
    status](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/orgs/members#get-organization-membership-for-a-user)
    will be `pending` until they accept the invitation.    *   Authenticated
    users can _update_ a user's membership by passing the `role` parameter. If
    the authenticated user changes a member's role to `admin`, the affected user
    will receive an email notifying them that they've been made an organization
    owner. If the authenticated user changes an owner's role to `member`, no
    email will be sent.**Rate limits**To prevent abuse, the authenticated user
    is limited to 50 organization invitations per 24 hour period. If the
    organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500
    invitations per 24 hour period.
