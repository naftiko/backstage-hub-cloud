    Lists the teams that have access to the specified repository and that are
    also visible to the authenticated user.For a public repository, a team is
    listed only if that team added the public repository explicitly.OAuth app
    tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `public_repo` or `repo`
    scope to use this endpoint with a public repository, and `repo` scope to use
    this endpoint with a private repository.
