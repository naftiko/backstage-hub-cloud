  description: >-
    The "Remove team member" endpoint (described below) is deprecated.We
    recommend using the [Remove team membership for a
    user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/teams/members#remove-team-membership-for-a-user)
    endpoint instead. It allows you to remove both active and pending
    memberships.Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
    Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
    products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
    in the GitHub Help documentation.To remove a team member, the authenticated
    user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the org
    that the team is associated with. Removing a team member does not delete the
    user, it just removes them from the team.**Note:** When you have team
    synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider
    (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making
    changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group
    membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team
    membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and
    removes team members in an organization. For more information, see
    "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise
    Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
