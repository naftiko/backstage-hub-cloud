  name: List Check Runs In A Check Suite
  description: >-
    Lists check runs for a check suite using its `id`.**Note:** The endpoints to
    manage checks only look for pushes in the repository where the check suite
    or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not
    detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.OAuth app tokens and
    personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint
    on a private repository.
