    To download the asset's binary content, set the `Accept` header of the
    request to
    [`application/octet-stream`](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types).
    The API will either redirect the client to the location, or stream it
    directly if possible. API clients should handle both a `200` or `302`
    response.
