    **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub Enterprise Server will discontinue the [OAuth
    Authorizations
    API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations),
    which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth
    tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application
    flow](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow).
    The [OAuth Authorizations
    API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations)
    will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including
    scheduled brownouts, see the [blog
    post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).
