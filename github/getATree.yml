    Returns a single tree using the SHA1 value or ref name for that tree.If
    `truncated` is `true` in the response then the number of items in the `tree`
    array exceeded our maximum limit. If you need to fetch more items, use the
    non-recursive method of fetching trees, and fetch one sub-tree at a
    time.**Note**: The limit for the `tree` array is 100,000 entries with a
    maximum size of 7 MB when using the `recursive` parameter.
