    **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub Enterprise Server will discontinue the [OAuth
    Authorizations
    API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations/),
    which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth
    tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application
    flow](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow).
    The [OAuth Authorizations
    API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/oauth-authorizations/oauth-authorizations/)
    will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including
    scheduled brownouts, see the [blog
    post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).Deleting
    an OAuth application's grant will also delete all OAuth tokens associated
    with the application for your user. Once deleted, the application has no
    access to your account and is no longer listed on [the application
    authorizations settings screen within
    GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications#authorized).
