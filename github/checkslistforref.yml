  name: List Check Runs For A Git Reference
  description: >-
    Lists check runs for a commit ref. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name, or a
    tag name.**Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in
    the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a
    branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty
    `pull_requests` array.If there are more than 1000 check suites on a single
    git reference, this endpoint will limit check runs to the 1000 most recent
    check suites. To iterate over all possible check runs, use the [List check
    suites for a Git
    reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-suites-for-a-git-reference)
    endpoint and provide the `check_suite_id` parameter to the [List check runs
    in a check
    suite](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-runs-in-a-check-suite)
    endpoint.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
    `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.
