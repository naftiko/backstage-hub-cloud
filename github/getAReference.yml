  description: >-
    Returns a single reference from your Git database. The `:ref` in the URL
    must be formatted as `heads/` for branches and `tags/` for tags. If the
    `:ref` doesn't match an existing ref, a `404` is returned.**Note:** You need
    to explicitly [request a pull
    request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request)
    to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull
    requests. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull
    requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
