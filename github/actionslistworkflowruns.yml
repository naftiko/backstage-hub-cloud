  name: List Workflow Runs For A Workflow
  description: >-
    List all workflow runs for a workflow. You can replace `workflow_id` with
    the workflow file name. For example, you could use `main.yaml`. You can use
    parameters to narrow the list of results. For more information about using
    parameters, see
    [Parameters](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#parameters).Anyone
    with read access to the repository can use this endpointOAuth app tokens and
    personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint
    with a private repository.
