  description: >-
    The "Add team member" endpoint (described below) is deprecated.We recommend
    using the [Add or update team membership for a
    user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/teams/members#add-or-update-team-membership-for-a-user)
    endpoint instead. It allows you to invite new organization members to your
    teams.Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
    Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
    products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
    in the GitHub Help documentation.To add someone to a team, the authenticated
    user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer in the team they're
    changing. The person being added to the team must be a member of the team's
    organization.**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team
    with your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if
    you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If
    you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage
    GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider,
    which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For
    more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider
    and GitHub Enterprise
    Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."Note
    that you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this
    endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP
    method](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#http-method)."
