  name: Remove Team Membership For A User
  description: >-
    To remove a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated user
    must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization
    that the team is associated with. Removing team membership does not delete
    the user, it just removes their membership from the team.Team
    synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise
    Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
    products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
    in the GitHub Help documentation.**Note:** When you have team
    synchronization set up for a team with your organization's identity provider
    (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making
    changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group
    membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team
    membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and
    removes team members in an organization. For more information, see
    "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise
    Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."**Note:**
    You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route
    `DELETE /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.
