                        The gist files to be updated, renamed, or deleted. Each
                        `key` must match the current filename

                        (including extension) of the targeted gist file. For
                        example: `hello.py`.


                        To delete a file, set the whole file to null. For example:
                        `hello.py : null`. The file will also be

                        deleted if the specified object does not contain at least
                        one of `content` or `filename`.

                          content: blah
