  name: Get A Team By Name
  description: >-
    Gets a team using the team's `slug`. To create the `slug`, GitHub Enterprise
    Server replaces special characters in the `name` string, changes all words
    to lowercase, and replaces spaces with a `-` separator. For example, `"My
    TEam Näme"` would become `my-team-name`.**Note:** You can also specify a
    team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `GET
    /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}`.
