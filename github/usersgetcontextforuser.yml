  description: >-
    Provides hovercard information. You can find out more about someone in
    relation to their pull requests, issues, repositories, and organizations.The
    `subject_type` and `subject_id` parameters provide context for the person's
    hovercard, which returns more information than without the parameters. For
    example, if you wanted to find out more about `octocat` who owns the
    `Spoon-Knife` repository via cURL, it would look like this:```shell curl -u
    username:token 
    https://api.github.com/users/octocat/hovercard?subject_type=repository&subject_id=1300192```OAuth
    app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use
    this endpoint.
