  description: >-
    OAuth applications and GitHub applications with OAuth authorizations can use
    this API method to reset a valid OAuth token without end-user involvement.
    Applications must save the "token" property in the response because changes
    take effect immediately. You must use [Basic
    Authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#basic-authentication)
    when accessing this endpoint, using the application's `client_id` and
    `client_secret` as the username and password. Invalid tokens will return
    `404 NOT FOUND`.
