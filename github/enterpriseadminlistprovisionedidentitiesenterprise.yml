    from an enterprise through a `patch` with `active` flag set to `false`, the
    account's metadata is preserved to allow the user to re-join the enterprise
    in the future. However, the user's account will be suspended and the user
    will not be able to sign-in. In order to permanently suspend the users

    `delete` request. Users that were not permanently deleted will be visible in
