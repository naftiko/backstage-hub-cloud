  name: Rerequest A Check Run
  description: >-
    Triggers GitHub to rerequest an existing check run, without pushing new code
    to a repository. This endpoint will trigger the [`check_run`
    webhook](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#check_run)
    event with the action `rerequested`. When a check run is `rerequested`, its
    `status` is reset to `queued` and the `conclusion` is cleared.For more
    information about how to re-run GitHub Actions jobs, see "[Re-run a job from
    a workflow
    run](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/actions/workflow-runs#re-run-a-job-from-a-workflow-run)".OAuth
    apps and personal access tokens (classic) cannot use this endpoint.
