  name: List Check Suites For A Git Reference
  description: >-
    Lists check suites for a commit `ref`. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name,
    or a tag name.**Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes
    in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to
    a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty
    `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.OAuth app tokens
    and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this
    endpoint on a private repository.
