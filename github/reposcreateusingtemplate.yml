  name: Create A Repository Using A Template
  description: >-
    Creates a new repository using a repository template. Use the
    `template_owner` and `template_repo` route parameters to specify the
    repository to use as the template. If the repository is not public, the
    authenticated user must own or be a member of an organization that owns the
    repository. To check if a repository is available to use as a template, get
    the repository's information using the [Get a
    repository](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository)
    endpoint and check that the `is_template` key is `true`.OAuth app tokens and
    personal access tokens (classic) need the `public_repo` or `repo` scope to
    create a public repository, and `repo` scope to create a private repository.
