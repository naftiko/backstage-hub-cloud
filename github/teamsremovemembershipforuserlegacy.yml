  description: >-
    **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be
    removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use
    the new [Remove team membership for a
    user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/teams/members#remove-team-membership-for-a-user)
    endpoint.Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
    Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
    products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
    in the GitHub Help documentation.To remove a membership between a user and a
    team, the authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be
    an owner of the organization that the team is associated with. Removing team
    membership does not delete the user, it just removes their membership from
    the team.**Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with
    your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you
    attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If you
    have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub
    Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which
    automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more
    information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and
    GitHub Enterprise
    Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
