  name: List Packages For A User
  description: >-
    Lists all packages in a user's namespace for which the requesting user has
    access.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
    `read:packages` scope to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to
    a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions,
    the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see
    "[About permissions for GitHub
    Packages](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#permissions-for-repository-scoped-packages)."
