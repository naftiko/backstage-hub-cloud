  description: >-
    Triggers GitHub to rerequest an existing check suite, without pushing new
    code to a repository. This endpoint will trigger the [`check_suite`
    webhook](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#check_suite)
    event with the action `rerequested`. When a check suite is `rerequested`,
    its `status` is reset to `queued` and the `conclusion` is cleared.OAuth apps
    and personal access tokens (classic) cannot use this endpoint.
