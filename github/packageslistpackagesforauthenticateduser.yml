    Lists packages owned by the authenticated user within the user's
    namespace.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
    `read:packages` scope to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to
    a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped permissions,
    the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these registries, see
