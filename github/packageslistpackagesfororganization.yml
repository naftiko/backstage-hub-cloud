    Lists packages in an organization readable by the user.OAuth app tokens and
    personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` scope to use this
    endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs to a GitHub Packages registry that
    only supports repository-scoped permissions, the `repo` scope is also
    required. For the list of these registries, see "[About permissions for
