  description: >-
    Removes an organization project from a team. An organization owner or a team
    maintainer can remove any project from the team. To remove a project from a
    team as an organization member, the authenticated user must have `read`
    access to both the team and project, or `admin` access to the team or
    project. This endpoint removes the project from the team, but does not
    delete the project.**Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and
    `team_id` using the route `DELETE
    /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/projects/{project_id}`.
