  name: Get A Check Run
  description: >-
    Gets a single check run using its `id`.**Note:** The Checks API only looks
    for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were
    created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and
    return an empty `pull_requests` array.OAuth app tokens and personal access
    tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private
    repository.
