  name: Create A Check Suite
  description: >-
    Creates a check suite manually. By default, check suites are automatically
    created when you create a [check
    run](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/checks/runs). You
    only need to use this endpoint for manually creating check suites when
    you've disabled automatic creation using "[Update repository preferences for
    check
    suites](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/checks/suites#update-repository-preferences-for-check-suites)".**Note:**
    The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite
    or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not
    detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for
    `head_branch`.OAuth apps and personal access tokens (classic) cannot use
    this endpoint.
