  name: Get A Check Suite
  description: >-
    Gets a single check suite using its `id`.**Note:** The Checks API only looks
    for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were
    created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and
    return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for
    `head_branch`.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
    `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.
