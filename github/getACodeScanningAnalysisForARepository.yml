    response contains fields that describe the analysis.This includes the Git
    reference and commit SHA to which the analysis relates,the datetime of the
    analysis, the name of the code scanning tool,and the number of alerts.The
    `rules_count` field in the default response give the number of rulesthat
    were run in the analysis.For very old analyses this data is not
    available,and `0` is returned in this field.This endpoint supports the
    following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media
    types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."-
    **`application/sarif+json`**: Instead of returning a summary of the
    analysis, this endpoint returns a subset of the analysis data that was
    uploaded. The data is formatted as [SARIF version
    2.1.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html).
    It also returns additional data such as the `github/alertNumber` and
    `github/alertUrl` properties.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens
    (classic) need the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint with private
    or public repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with
    only public repositories.
