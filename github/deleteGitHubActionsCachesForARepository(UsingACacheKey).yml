  description: >-
    Deletes one or more GitHub Actions caches for a repository, using a complete
    cache key. By default, all caches that match the provided key are deleted,
    but you can optionally provide a Git ref to restrict deletions to caches
    that match both the provided key and the Git ref.OAuth tokens and personal
    access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
