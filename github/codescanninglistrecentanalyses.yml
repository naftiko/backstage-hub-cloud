    with the most recent.The response is paginated and you can use the `page`
    and `per_page` parametersto list the analyses you're interested in.By
    default 30 analyses are listed per page.The `rules_count` field in the
    response give the number of rulesthat were run in the analysis.For very old
    analyses this data is not available,and `0` is returned in this
    field.**Deprecation notice**:The `tool_name` field is deprecated and will,

    response reflects this change. The tool name can now be found inside the
    `tool` field.OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
    `security_events` scope to use this endpoint with private or public
