                      description: >-
                        The state of the status. When you set a transient deployment
                        to `inactive`, the deployment will be shown as `destroyed`
                        in GitHub.

                        - error

                    target_url:
                      type: string
                      description: >-
                        The target URL to associate with this status. This URL
                        should contain output to keep the user updated while the
                        task is running or serve as historical information for what
                        happened in the deployment. **Note:** It's recommended to
                        use the `log_url` parameter, which replaces `target_url`.
                      default: ''
                    log_url:
                      type: string
                      description: >-
                        The full URL of the deployment's output. This parameter
                        replaces `target_url`. We will continue to accept
                        `target_url` to support legacy uses, but we recommend
                        replacing `target_url` with `log_url`. Setting `log_url`
                        will automatically set `target_url` to the same value.
                        Default: `""`
                      default: ''

                        A short description of the status. The maximum description
                        length is 140 characters.

                        Name for the target deployment environment, which can be
                        changed when setting a deploy status. For example,
                        `production`, `staging`, or `qa`. If not defined, the
                        environment of the previous status on the deployment will be
                        used, if it exists. Otherwise, the environment of the
                        deployment will be used.

                        non-production environment deployments with the same
                        repository and `environment` name as the created status's
                        deployment. An `inactive` status is only added to
                        deployments that had a `success` state. Default: `true`
