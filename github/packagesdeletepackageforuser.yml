    Deletes an entire package for a user. You cannot delete a public package if
    any version of the package has more than 5,000 downloads. In this scenario,
    contact GitHub support for further assistance.If the `package_type` belongs
    to a GitHub Packages registry that supports granular permissions, the
    authenticated user must have admin permissions to the package. For the list
    of these registries, see "[About permissions for GitHub

    app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:packages` and
    `delete:packages` scopes to use this endpoint. If the `package_type` belongs
    to a GitHub Packages registry that only supports repository-scoped
    permissions, the `repo` scope is also required. For the list of these
