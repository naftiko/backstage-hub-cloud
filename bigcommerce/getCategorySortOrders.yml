  description: >-
    Returns a list of products and their sort order for a specific
    category.**Usage Notes*** Data pairs are displayed in ascending order based
    on products' `sort_order` values.* `null` values are allowed for products
    without specified `sort_order` values.* Products with `sort_order` value of
    `null` will be displayed after products with valid numerical values.* The
    priorities for determining product sort order on a storefront are the
    following:  - Priority 1: Manually specified sort order on Category Level
    (API).  - Priority 2: Manually specified sort order on Product (Global)
    Level (UI/API).  - Priority 3: Default sorting by Product ID (newly added
    products go first) (UI/API).
