    `custom_items`. Overriding a product’s `list_price` will make that item
    ineligible for V3 product level promotions.If a product has modifiers, omit
    the `variant_id` and instead use the `option_selections` array to describe
    both the **variant** and the **modifier** selections.Please note that this
