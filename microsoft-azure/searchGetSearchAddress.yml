  description: >-
    **Address Geocoding****Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.In many cases,
    the complete search service might be too much, for instance if you are only
    interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed for address
    look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the geocode
    endpoint with just the address or partial address in question. The geocoding
    search index will be queried for everything above the street level data. No
    POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is very tolerant of typos and
    incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything from exact street
    addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies
    such as city centers, counties, states etc.
