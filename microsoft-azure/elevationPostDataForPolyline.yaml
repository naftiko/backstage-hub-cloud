  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier. The Post Data for Polyline API provides
    elevation data along a polyline. A polyline is defined by  passing in
    between 2 and N endpoint coordinates separated by a pipe ('|') character. In
    addition  to passing in endpoints, customers can specify the number of
    sample points that will be used to divide  polyline into equally spaced
    segments. Elevation data at both start and end points and equally spaced 
    points along the polyline will be returned. A line between two endpoints is
    a straight Cartesian line, the  shortest line between those two points in
    the coordinate reference system. Note that the point is  chosen based on
    Euclidean distance and may markedly differ from the geodesic path along the
    curved  surface of the reference ellipsoid.
