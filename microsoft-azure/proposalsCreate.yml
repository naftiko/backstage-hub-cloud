    Submit a proposed change to the service. This will be assigned an ID by the
    service. Submitting the same signature (including signed COSE headers such
    as created_at) multiple times will be treated as a single idempotent
    operation, returning a single created proposal (or an error if it is no
    longer available). Any change to the request body will be treated as a new,
    separate proposal.
