    Appends to the specified file, optionally first creating the file if it does
    not yet exist. This method supports multiple concurrent appends to the file.
    NOTE: The target must not contain data added by Create or normal (serial)
    Append. ConcurrentAppend and Append cannot be used interchangeably; once a
    target file has been modified using either of these append options, the
    other append option cannot be used on the target file. ConcurrentAppend does
    not guarantee order and can result in duplicated data landing in the target
    file.
