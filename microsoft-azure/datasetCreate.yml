    [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).Creator makes it possible to
    develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps
    API and SDK.
    [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps)
    article introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator. This
    API allows the caller to create a dataset from data that was uploaded to the
    Azure Maps Data Service and converted using the Azure Maps Conversion
    Service.You can use this API in a scenario like uploading a DWG zip package
    for a building, converting the zip package using the Azure Maps Conversion
    Service, and creating a dataset from the converted zip package. The created
    dataset can be used to create tilesets using the Azure Maps Tileset Service
    and can be queried via the Azure Maps WFS Service.### Submit Create
    RequestTo create your dataset, you will use a `POST` request where the
    `conversionId` query parameter is an ID that represents the converted DWG
    zip package, the `datasetId` parameter will be the ID of a previously
    created dataset to append with the current dataset and, optionally, the
    `description` query parameter will contain a description (if description is
    not provided a default description will be given).The Create API is a
    [long-running operation](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).
