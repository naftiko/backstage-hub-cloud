    This operation generates a list of words, or tags, that are relevant to the
    content of the supplied image. The Computer Vision API can return tags based
    on objects, living beings, scenery or actions found in images. Unlike
    categories, tags are not organized according to a hierarchical
    classification system, but correspond to image content. Tags may contain
    hints to avoid ambiguity or provide context, for example the tag 'cello' may
    be accompanied by the hint 'musical instrument'. All tags are in English.
