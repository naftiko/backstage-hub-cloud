    When you delete a Job Schedule, this also deletes all Jobs and Tasks under
    thatschedule. When Tasks are deleted, all the files in their working
    directories onthe Compute Nodes are also deleted (the retention period is
    ignored). The JobSchedule statistics are no longer accessible once the Job
    Schedule is deleted,though they are still counted towards Account lifetime
    statistics.
