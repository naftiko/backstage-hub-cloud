  description: >-
    Gets the information about health of an application deployed on a Service
    Fabric node using the specified policy. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to
    optionally filter for the collection of HealthEvent objects reported on the
    deployed application based on health state. Use
    DeployedServicePackagesHealthStateFilter to optionally filter for
    DeployedServicePackageHealth children based on health state. Use
    ApplicationHealthPolicy to optionally override the health policies used to
    evaluate the health. This API only uses 'ConsiderWarningAsError' field of
    the ApplicationHealthPolicy. The rest of the fields are ignored while
    evaluating the health of the deployed application.
