    __Route Range (Isochrone) API__<br><br><br>**Applies to**: S1 pricing
    tier.<br><br>This service will calculate a set of locations that can be
    reached from the origin point based on fuel, energy,  time or distance
    budget that is specified. A polygon boundary (or Isochrone) is returned in a
    counterclockwise  orientation as well as the precise polygon center which
    was the result of the origin point.<br><br>The returned polygon can be used
    for further processing such as  [Search Inside
    Geometry](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/search/postsearchinsidegeometry)
    to  search for POIs within the provided Isochrone.
