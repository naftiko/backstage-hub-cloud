    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.<br><br>This API will return the
    great-circle or shortest distance between two points on the surface of a
    sphere, measured along the surface of the sphere.  This differs from
    calculating a straight line through the sphere's interior. This method is
    helpful for estimating travel distances for airplanes by calculating the
    shortest distance between airports.
