    When you call this API, the Batch service sets a disabled Job to the
    enabling state. After the this operation is completed, the Job moves to the
    active state, and scheduling of new Tasks under the Job resumes. The Batch
    service does not allow a Task to remain in the active state for more than
    180 days. Therefore, if you enable a Job containing active Tasks which were
    added more than 180 days ago, those Tasks will not run.
