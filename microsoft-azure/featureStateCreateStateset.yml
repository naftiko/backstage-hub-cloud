    POST API allows the user to create a new Stateset and define stateset style
    using request body.Creator makes it possible to develop applications based
    on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. The Feature
    State API is part of Creator. The Feature State service allows the user to
    update the states of a feature and query them to be used in other services.
    The dynamic properties of a feature that don't belong to the dataset are
    referred to as *states* here.This Feature State service pivot on the
    Stateset. Like Tileset, Stateset encapsulates the storage mechanism for
    feature states for a dataset.Once the stateset is created, users can use
    that statesetId to post feature state updates and retrieve the current
    feature states. A feature can have only one state at a given point in time.
    Feature state is defined by the key name, value and the timestamp. When a
    feature state update is posted to Azure Maps, the state value gets updated
    only if the provided state’s timestamp is later than the stored timestamp.
    Azure Maps MapControl provides a way to use these feature states to style
    the features. Please refer to the [State Tile
