    Deleting a Job also deletes all Tasks that are part of that Job, and all Job
    statistics. This also overrides the retention period for Task data; that is,
    if the Job contains Tasks which are still retained on Compute Nodes, the
    Batch services deletes those Tasks' working directories and all their
    contents.  When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the
    Job to the deleting state. All update operations on a Job that is in
    deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional
    information indicating that the Job is being deleted.
