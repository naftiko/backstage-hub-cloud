    If you try to delete a Certificate that is being used by a Pool or Compute
    Node, the status of the Certificate changes to deleteFailed. If you decide
    that you want to continue using the Certificate, you can use this operation
    to set the status of the Certificate back to active. If you intend to delete
    the Certificate, you do not need to run this operation after the deletion
    failed. You must make sure that the Certificate is not being used by any
    resources, and then you can try again to delete the
    Certificate.<br><br>Warning: This operation is deprecated and will be
    removed after February, 2024. Please use the [Azure KeyVault
    Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-certificate-migration-guide)
    instead.
