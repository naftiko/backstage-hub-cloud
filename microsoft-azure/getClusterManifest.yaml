    Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest. The cluster manifest contains
    properties of the cluster that include different node types on the
    cluster,security configurations, fault, and upgrade domain topologies,
    etc.These properties are specified as part of the ClusterConfig.JSON file
    while deploying a stand-alone cluster. However, most of the information in
    the cluster manifestis generated internally by service fabric during cluster
    deployment in other deployment scenarios (e.g. when using Azure portal).The
    contents of the cluster manifest are for informational purposes only and
    users are not expected to take a dependency on the format of the file
    contents or its interpretation.
