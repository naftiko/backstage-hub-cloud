    This operation applies only to Batch accounts with
    allowedAuthenticationModes containing 'SharedKey'. If the Batch account
    doesn't contain 'SharedKey' in its allowedAuthenticationMode, clients cannot
    use shared keys to authenticate, and must use another
    allowedAuthenticationModes instead. In this case, regenerating the keys will
    fail.
