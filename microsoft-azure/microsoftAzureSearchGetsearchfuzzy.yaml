    <br>**Free Form Search**<br><br>**Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing
    tiers.<br><br><br>The basic default API is Free Form Search which handles
    the most fuzzy of inputs handling any combination of address or POI tokens.
    This search API is the canonical 'single line search'. The Free Form Search
    API is a seamless combination of POI search and geocoding. The API can also
    be weighted with a contextual position (lat./lon. pair), or fully
    constrained by a coordinate and radius, or it can be executed more generally
    without any geo biasing anchor point.We strongly advise you to use the
    'countrySet' parameter to specify only the countries for which your
    application needs coverage, as the default behavior will be to search the
    entire world, potentially returning unnecessary results. E.g.:
    `countrySet`=US,FR Please see [Search
    Coverage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/location-based-services/geocoding-coverage)
    for a complete list of all the supported countries.Most Search queries
    default to `maxFuzzyLevel`=2 to gain performance and also reduce unusual
    results. This new default can be overridden as needed per request by passing
    in the query param `maxFuzzyLevel`=3 or 4.
