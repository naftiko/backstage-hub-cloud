    The Batch Service immediately moves the Job to the disabling state. Batch
    then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do with the
    currently running Tasks of the Job. The Job remains in the disabling state
    until the disable operation is completed and all Tasks have been dealt with
    according to the disableTasks option; the Job then moves to the disabled
    state. No new Tasks are started under the Job until it moves back to active
    state. If you try to disable a Job that is in any state other than active,
    disabling, or disabled, the request fails with status code 409.
