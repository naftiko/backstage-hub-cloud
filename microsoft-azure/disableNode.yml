    Deactivate A Service Fabric Cluster Node With The Specified Deactivation
    Intent.
  description: >-
    Deactivate a Service Fabric cluster node with the specified deactivation
    intent. Once the deactivation is in progress, the deactivation intent can be
    increased, but not decreased (for example, a node that is deactivated with
    the Pause intent can be deactivated further with Restart, but not the other
    way around. Nodes may be reactivated using the Activate a node operation any
    time after they are deactivated. If the deactivation is not complete, this
    will cancel the deactivation. A node that goes down and comes back up while
    deactivated will still need to be reactivated before services will be placed
    on that node.
