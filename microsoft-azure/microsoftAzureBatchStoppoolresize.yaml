    This does not restore the Pool to its previous state before the
    resize<br>operation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the
    Pool maintains<br>its current state. After stopping, the Pool stabilizes at
    the number of Compute<br>Nodes it was at when the stop operation was done.
    During the stop operation,<br>the Pool allocation state changes first to
    stopping and then to steady. A<br>resize operation need not be an explicit
    resize Pool request; this API can also<br>be used to halt the initial sizing
    of the Pool when it is created.
