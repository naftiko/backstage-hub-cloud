  description: >-
    Create and train a multivariate anomaly detection model. The request
    mustinclude a source parameter to indicate an Azure BlobStorage URI that's
    accessible to the service. There are two types of data input. The Blob
    Storage URI can point to an Azure BlobStorage folder that contains multiple
    CSV files, where each CSV file hastwo columns, time stamp and variable. Or
    the Blob Storage URI can point to a single blob that contains a CSV file
    that has all the variables and atime stamp column.The model object will be
    created and returned in the response, but thetraining process happens
    asynchronously. To check the training status, callGetMultivariateModel with
    the modelId value and check the status field in themodelInfo object.
