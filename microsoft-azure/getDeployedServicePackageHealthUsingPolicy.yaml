    Gets the information about health of a service package for a specific
    application deployed on a Service Fabric node. using the specified policy.
    Use EventsHealthStateFilter to optionally filter for the collection of
    HealthEvent objects reported on the deployed service package based on health
    state. Use ApplicationHealthPolicy to optionally override the health
    policies used to evaluate the health. This API only uses
    'ConsiderWarningAsError' field of the ApplicationHealthPolicy. The rest of
    the fields are ignored while evaluating the health of the deployed service
    package.
