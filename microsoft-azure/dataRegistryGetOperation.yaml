    The `Get Operation` API is an HTTP `GET` request used to get the status of a
    [data register or replace](/rest/api/maps/data-registry/register-or-replace)
    request is returned in the header of the register or replace response as the
    value of the `Operation-Location` key. While in progress, a HTTP `200 OK`
    response will be returned with `Retry-After` header - followed by a HTTP
    `200 OK` with no extra header once completed.The data registry service
    endpoint is limited in scope to the region of your Azure Maps account and is
    not available for global Azure Maps accounts.
