  name: Returns A List Of Batch Requests Submitted And The Status For Each Request
  description: >-
    Returns a list of batch requests submitted and the status for each
    request.This list only contains batch requests submitted by the user (based
    on the resource).            If the number of requests exceeds our paging
    limit, server-side paging is used. Paginated responses indicate a partial
    result and include a continuation token in the response.The absence of a
    continuation token means that no additional pages are available.           
    $top, $skip and $maxpagesize query parameters can be used to specify a
    number of results to return and an offset for the collection.           
    $top indicates the total number of records the user wants to be returned
    across all pages.$skip indicates the number of records to skip from the list
    of batches based on the sorting method specified.  By default, we sort by
    descending start time.$maxpagesize is the maximum items returned in a page. 
    If more items are requested via $top (or $top is not specified and there are
    more items to be returned), @nextLink will contain the link to the next
    page.            $orderBy query parameter can be used to sort the returned
    list (ex "$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc asc" or "$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc
    desc").The default sorting is descending by createdDateTimeUtc.Some query
    parameters can be used to filter the returned list (ex:
    "status=Succeeded,Cancelled") will only return succeeded and cancelled
    operations.createdDateTimeUtcStart and createdDateTimeUtcEnd can be used
    combined or separately to specify a range of datetime to filter the returned
    list by.The supported filtering query parameters are (status, ids,
    createdDateTimeUtcStart, createdDateTimeUtcEnd).            The server
    honors the values specified by the client. However, clients must be prepared
    to handle responses that contain a different page size or contain a
    continuation token.            When both $top and $skip are included, the
    server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.Note: If the
    server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to the
    client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query options.This
    reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the data returned.
