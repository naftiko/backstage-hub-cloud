    Disables periodic backup of partition which was previously enabled. Backup
    must be explicitly enabled before it can be disabled. In case the backup is
    enabled for the Service Fabric application or service, which this partition
    is part of, this partition would continue to be periodically backed up as
    per the policy mapped at the higher level entity.
