    The `Get API Definition` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns details
    of the capabilities of each API in the Features service, including the
    request type (`GET` or `POST`) a `description`, `operationId`, `parameters`,
    and `responses`. It can be used by developers to understand the API or by
    development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.The
    Features API is a part of [Creator](/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps),
    which makes it possible to develop applications based on your private indoor
    map data using Azure Maps API and SDK. Features GET APIs follow the [Open
    Geospatial Consortium API - Features - Part 1: Core
    corrigendum](http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0.1) standard
    to query [Datasets](/rest/api/maps-creator/dataset). Datasets consist of
    multiple feature collections, which are a grouping of
    [features](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) defined by a
    common schema.
