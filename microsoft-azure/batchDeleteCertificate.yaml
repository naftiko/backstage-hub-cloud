    You cannot delete a Certificate if a resource (Pool or Compute Node) is
    usingit. Before you can delete a Certificate, you must therefore make sure
    that theCertificate is not associated with any existing Pools, the
    Certificate is notinstalled on any Nodes (even if you remove a Certificate
    from a Pool, it is notremoved from existing Compute Nodes in that Pool until
    they restart), and norunning Tasks depend on the Certificate. If you try to
    delete a Certificatethat is in use, the deletion fails. The Certificate
    status changes todeleteFailed. You can use Cancel Delete Certificate to set
    the status back toactive if you decide that you want to continue using the
    Certificate.
