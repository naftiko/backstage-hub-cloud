    Submit an operation to take a snapshot of face list, large face list, person
    group or large person group, with user-specified snapshot type, source
    object id, apply scope and an optional user data.The snapshot interfaces are
    for users to backup and restore their face data from one face subscription
    to another, inside same region or across regions. The workflow contains two
    phases, user first calls Snapshot - Take to create a copy of the source
    object and store it as a snapshot, then calls Snapshot - Apply to paste the
    snapshot to target subscription. The snapshots are stored in a centralized
    location (per Azure instance), so that they can be applied cross accounts
    and regions.Taking snapshot is an asynchronous operation. An operation id
    can be obtained from the "Operation-Location" field in response header, to
    be used in OperationStatus - Get for tracking the progress of creating the
    snapshot. The snapshot id will be included in the "resourceLocation" field
    in OperationStatus - Get response when the operation status is
    "succeeded".Snapshot taking time depends on the number of person and face
    entries in the source object. It could be in seconds, or up to several hours
    for 1,000,000 persons with multiple faces.Snapshots will be automatically
    expired and cleaned in 48 hours after it is created by Snapshot - Take. User
    can delete the snapshot using Snapshot - Delete by themselves any time
    before expiration.Taking snapshot for a certain object will not block any
    other operations against the object. All read-only operations (Get/List and
    Identify/FindSimilar/Verify) can be conducted as usual. For all writable
    operations, including Add/Update/Delete the source object or its
    persons/faces and Train, they are not blocked but not recommended because
    writable updates may not be reflected on the snapshot during its taking.
    After snapshot taking is completed, all readable and writable operations can
    work as normal. Snapshot will also include the training results of the
    source object, which means target subscription the snapshot applied to does
    not need re-train the target object before calling Identify/FindSimilar.*
