    Divide candidate faces into groups based on face similarity.<br>* The output
    is one or more disjointed face groups and a messyGroup. A face group
    contains faces that have similar looking, often of the same person. Face
    groups are ranked by group size, i.e. number of faces. Notice that faces
    belonging to a same person might be split into several groups in the
    result.<br>* MessyGroup is a special face group containing faces that cannot
    find any similar counterpart face from original faces. The messyGroup will
    not appear in the result if all faces found their counterparts.<br>* Group
    API needs at least 2 candidate faces and 1000 at most. We suggest to try
    [Face -
    Verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/verifyfacetoface)
    when you only have 2 candidate faces.<br>* The 'recognitionModel' associated
    with the query faces' faceIds should be the same.<br>
