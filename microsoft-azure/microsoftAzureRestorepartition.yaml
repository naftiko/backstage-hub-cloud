    Restores the state of a of the stateful persisted partition using the
    specified backup point. In case the partition is already being periodically
    backed up, then by default the backup point is looked for in the storage
    specified in backup policy. One can also override the same by specifying the
    backup storage details as part of the restore partition description in body.
    Once the restore is initiated, its progress can be tracked using the
    GetRestoreProgress operation. <br>In case, the operation times out, specify
    a greater restore timeout value in the query parameter.
