    You can only resize a Pool when its allocation state is steady. If the Pool
    is<br>already resizing, the request fails with status code 409. When you
    resize a<br>Pool, the Pool's allocation state changes from steady to
    resizing. You cannot<br>resize Pools which are configured for automatic
    scaling. If you try to do this,<br>the Batch service returns an error 409.
    If you resize a Pool downwards, the<br>Batch service chooses which Compute
    Nodes to remove. To remove specific Compute<br>Nodes, use the Pool remove
    Compute Nodes API instead.
