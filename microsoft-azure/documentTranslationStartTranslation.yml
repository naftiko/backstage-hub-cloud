  name: Submit A Document Translation Request To The Document Translation Service
  description: >-
    Use this API to submit a bulk (batch) translation request to the Document
    Translation service.Each request can contain multiple documents and must
    contain a source and destination container for each document.            The
    prefix and suffix filter (if supplied) are used to filter folders. The
    prefix is applied to the subpath after the container name.           
    Glossaries / Translation memory can be included in the request and are
    applied by the service when the document is translated.            If the
    glossary is invalid or unreachable during translation, an error is indicated
    in the document status.If a file with the same name already exists at the
    destination, it will be overwritten. The targetUrl for each target language
    must be unique.
