  description: >-
    Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or
    in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. These
    results are of application types whose name match exactly the one specified
    as the parameter, and which comply with the given query parameters. All
    versions of the application type matching the application type name are
    returned, with each version returned as one application type. The response
    includes the name, version, status, and other details about the application
    type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application
    types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a
    continuation token, which can be used to get the next page. For example, if
    there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first three
    application types, or if max results is set to 3, then three is returned. To
    access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the
    returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token
    is returned if there are no subsequent pages.
