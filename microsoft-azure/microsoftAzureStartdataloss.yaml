    This API will induce data loss for the specified partition. It will trigger
    a call to the OnDataLoss API of the partition.<br>Actual data loss will
    depend on the specified DataLossMode.<br><br>- PartialDataLoss - Only a
    quorum of replicas are removed and OnDataLoss is triggered for the partition
    but actual data loss depends on the presence of in-flight replication.<br>-
    FullDataLoss - All replicas are removed hence all data is lost and
    OnDataLoss is triggered.<br><br>This API should only be called with a
    stateful service as the target.<br><br>Calling this API with a system
    service as the target is not advised.<br><br>Note:  Once this API has been
    called, it cannot be reversed. Calling CancelOperation will only stop
    execution and clean up internal system state.<br>It will not restore data if
    the command has progressed far enough to cause data loss.<br><br>Call the
    GetDataLossProgress API with the same OperationId to return information on
    the operation started with this API.
