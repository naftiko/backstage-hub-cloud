    You can only resize a Pool when its allocation state is steady. If the Pool
    is already resizing, the request fails with status code 409. When you resize
    a Pool, the Pool's allocation state changes from steady to resizing. You
    cannot resize Pools which are configured for automatic scaling. If you try
    to do this, the Batch service returns an error 409. If you resize a Pool
    downwards, the Batch service chooses which Compute Nodes to remove. To
    remove specific Compute Nodes, use the Pool remove Compute Nodes API
    instead.
