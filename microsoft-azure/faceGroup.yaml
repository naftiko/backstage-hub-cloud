    Divide candidate faces into groups based on face similarity.* The output is
    one or more disjointed face groups and a messyGroup. A face group contains
    faces that have similar looking, often of the same person. Face groups are
    ranked by group size, i.e. number of faces. Notice that faces belonging to a
    same person might be split into several groups in the result.* MessyGroup is
    a special face group containing faces that cannot find any similar
    counterpart face from original faces. The messyGroup will not appear in the
    result if all faces found their counterparts.* Group API needs at least 2
    candidate faces and 1000 at most. We suggest to try [Face -
    Verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/verifyfacetoface)
    when you only have 2 candidate faces.* The 'recognitionModel' associated
    with the query faces' faceIds should be the same.
