  name: Detect Anomalies For The Entire Series In Batch.
  description: >-
    This operation generates a model with an entire series. Each point is
    detectedwith the same model. With this method, points before and after a
    certain pointare used to determine whether it's an anomaly. The entire
    detection can give theuser an overall status of the time series.
