  name: Create Or Update Assessment.
  description: >-
    Create a new assessment with the given name and the specified settings.
    Since name of an assessment in a project is a unique identifier, if an
    assessment with the name provided already exists, then the existing
    assessment is updated.Any PUT operation, resulting in either create or
    update on an assessment, will cause the assessment to go in a "InProgress"
    state. This will be indicated by the field 'computationState' on the
    Assessment object. During this time no other PUT operation will be allowed
    on that assessment object, nor will a Delete operation. Once the computation
    for the assessment is complete, the field 'computationState' will be updated
    to 'Ready', and then other PUT or DELETE operations can happen on the
    assessment.When assessment is under computation, any PUT will lead to a 400
    - Bad Request error.
