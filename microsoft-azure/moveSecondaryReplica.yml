  name: Moves The Secondary Replica Of A Partition Of A Stateful Service.
  description: >-
    This command moves the secondary replica of a partition of a stateful
    service, respecting all constraints.CurrentNodeName parameter must be
    specified to identify the replica that is moved.Source node name must be
    specified, but new node name can be omitted, and in that case replica is
    moved to a random node.If IgnoreConstraints parameter is specified and set
    to true, then secondary will be moved regardless of the constraints.
