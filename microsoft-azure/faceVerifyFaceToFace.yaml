    Verify whether two faces belong to a same person or whether one face belongs
    to a person.Remarks:* Higher face image quality means better identification
    precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size
    is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.* For the scenarios
    that are sensitive to accuracy please make your own judgment.* The
    'recognitionModel' associated with the query faces' faceIds should be the
    same as the 'recognitionModel' used by the target face, person group or
    large person group.
