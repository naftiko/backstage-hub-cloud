    Lists the endpoints that a Batch Compute Node under this Batch Account may
    call as part of Batch service administration. If you are deploying a Pool
    inside of a virtual network that you specify, you must make sure your
    network allows outbound access to these endpoints. Failure to allow access
    to these endpoints may cause Batch to mark the affected nodes as unusable.
    For more information about creating a pool inside of a virtual network, see
