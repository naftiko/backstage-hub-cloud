  name: Get Spatial Pointinpolygon Format
  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.This API returns a boolean value indicating
    whether a point is inside a set of polygons. The set of polygons is provided
    by a GeoJSON file which is uploaded via [Data Upload
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and
    referenced by a unique udid. The GeoJSON file may contain Polygon and
    MultiPolygon geometries, other geometries will be ignored if provided. If
    the point is inside or on the boundary of one of these polygons, the value
    returned is true. In all other cases, the value returned is false. When the
    point is inside multiple polygons, the result will give intersecting
    geometries section to show all valid geometries(referenced by geometryId) in
    user data. The maximum number of vertices accepted to form a Polygon is
    10,000. To test this API, you can upload the sample data from [Post Point In
    Polygon
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/postpointinpolygon#examples)
    examples (Request Body) via [Data Upload
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and
    replace the `{udid}` from the [sample request
    below](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/getpointinpolygon#examples)
    with the udid returned by Data Upload API.
