    You cannot delete a Certificate if a resource (Pool or Compute Node) is
    using<br>it. Before you can delete a Certificate, you must therefore make
    sure that the<br>Certificate is not associated with any existing Pools, the
    Certificate is not<br>installed on any Nodes (even if you remove a
    Certificate from a Pool, it is not<br>removed from existing Compute Nodes in
    that Pool until they restart), and no<br>running Tasks depend on the
    Certificate. If you try to delete a Certificate<br>that is in use, the
    deletion fails. The Certificate status changes to<br>deleteFailed. You can
    use Cancel Delete Certificate to set the status back to<br>active if you
    decide that you want to continue using the Certificate.
