  name: Get Spatial Greatcircledistance Format
  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.This API will return the great-circle or
    shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, measured
    along the surface of the sphere.  This differs from calculating a straight
    line through the sphere's interior. This method is helpful for estimating
    travel distances for airplanes by calculating the shortest distance between
    airports.
