  description: >-
    1-to-many identification to find the closest matches of the specific query
    person face from a person group, large person group, person directory
    dynamic person group or person directory personIds array. For each face in
    the faceIds array, Face Identify will compute similarities between the query
    face and all the faces in the person group (given by personGroupId) or large
    person group (given by largePersonGroupId), and return candidate person(s)
    for that face ranked by similarity confidence. The person group/large person
    group should be trained to make it ready for identification. See more in
    [PersonGroup -
    Train](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroup/train) and
    [LargePersonGroup -
    Train](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largepersongroup/train).
    Remarks:* The algorithm allows more than one face to be identified
    independently at the same request, but no more than 10 faces.* Each person
    in the person group/large person group could have more than one face, but no
    more than 248 faces.* Higher face image quality means better identification
    precision. Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size
    is 200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.* Number of candidates
    returned is restricted by maxNumOfCandidatesReturned and
    confidenceThreshold. If no person is identified, the returned candidates
    will be an empty array.* Try [Face - Find
    Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/findsimilar) when
    you need to find similar faces from a face list/large face list instead of a
    person group/large person group.* The 'recognitionModel' associated with the
    query faces' faceIds should be the same as the 'recognitionModel' used by
    the target person group or large person group.
