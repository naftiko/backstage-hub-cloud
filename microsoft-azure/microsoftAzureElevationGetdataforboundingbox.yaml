    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.<br><br>The Get Data for Bounding Box API
    provides elevation data at equally spaced locations within a bounding box. A
    bounding box is defined by the coordinates for two corners (southwest,
    northeast) and then subsequently  divided into rows and columns.<br><br>
    Elevations are returned for the vertices of the grid created by the rows
    and  columns. Up to 2,000 elevations can be returned in a single request.
    The returned elevation values are ordered,  starting at the southwest
    corner, and then proceeding west to east along the row. At the end of the
    row,  it moves north to the next row, and repeats the process until it
    reaches the far northeast corner.
