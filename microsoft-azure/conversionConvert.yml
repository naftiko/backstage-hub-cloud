    [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).Creator makes it possible to
    develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps
    API and SDK.
    [This](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps)
    article introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator.The
    Conversion API lets the caller import a set of DWG design files as a zipped
    [Drawing Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) into Azure Maps. The
    [Drawing Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) should first be
    uploaded using the [Azure Maps Data
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data). Once uploaded, use
    the `udid` returned by the [Data Upload
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data-v2/upload-preview) to
    call this Conversion API.## Convert DWG packageThe Conversion API performs a
    [long-running operation](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).## Debug DWG
    package issuesDuring the Conversion process, if there are any issues with
    the DWG package [errors and warnings](https://aka.ms/am-conversion-errors)
    are provided in the response along with a *diagnostic package* to visualize
    and diagnose these issues. In case any issues are encountered with your DWG
    package, the Conversion operation status process as detailed
    [here](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2) returns the location of the
    *diagnostic package* that can be downloaded by the caller to help them
    visualize and diagnose these issues. The *diagnostic package* location can
    be found in the properties section of the conversion operation status
    response and looks like the following:```json{    "properties": {       
    "diagnosticPackageLocation":
    "https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapdata/{DiagnosticPackageId}?api-version=1.0"                   
    }            }```The *diagnostic package* can be downloaded by executing a
    `HTTP GET` request on the `diagnosticPackageLocation`.For more details on
    how to use the tool to visualize and diagnose all the errors and warnings
    see [Drawing Error Visualizer](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-errors-visualizer).
    A conversion operation will be marked as *success* if there are zero or more
    warnings but will be marked as *failed* if any errors are encountered.
