    This method is used to obtain the site seal information for an issued
    certificate. A site seal is a graphic that the certificate purchaser can
    embed on their web site to show their visitors information about their SSL
    certificate. If a web site visitor clicks on the site seal image, a pop-up
    page is displayed that contains detailed information about the SSL
    certificate. The site seal token is used to link the site seal graphic image
    to the appropriate certificate details pop-up page display when a user
    clicks on the site seal. The site seal images are expected to be static
    images and hosted by the reseller, to minimize delays for customer page load
    times.
