  name: Cancels A User-induced Fault Operation.
  description: >-
    The following APIs start fault operations that may be cancelled by using
    CancelOperation: StartDataLoss, StartQuorumLoss, StartPartitionRestart,
    StartNodeTransition.If force is false, then the specified user-induced
    operation will be gracefully stopped and cleaned up.  If force is true, the
    command will be aborted, and some internal statemay be left behind. 
    Specifying force as true should be used with care.  Calling this API with
    force set to true is not allowed until this API has alreadybeen called on
    the same test command with force set to false first, or unless the test
    command already has an OperationState of
    OperationState.RollingBack.Clarification: OperationState.RollingBack means
    that the system will be/is cleaning up internal system state caused by
    executing the command.  It will not restore data if thetest command was to
    cause data loss.  For example, if you call StartDataLoss then call this API,
    the system will only clean up internal state from running the command.It
    will not restore the target partition's data, if the command progressed far
    enough to cause data loss.Important note:  if this API is invoked with
    force==true, internal state may be left behind.
