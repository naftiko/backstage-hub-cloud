    The update operation can be used to update the SKU, encryption, access tier,
    or tags for a storage account. It can also be used to map the account to a
    custom domain. Only one custom domain is supported per storage account; the
    replacement/change of custom domain is not supported. In order to replace an
    old custom domain, the old value must be cleared/unregistered before a new
    value can be set. The update of multiple properties is supported. This call
    does not change the storage keys for the account. If you want to change the
    storage account keys, use the regenerate keys operation. The location and
    name of the storage account cannot be changed after creation.
