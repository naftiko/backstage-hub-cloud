    Create and train a multivariate anomaly detection model. The request
    must<br>include a source parameter to indicate an Azure Blob<br>Storage URI
    that's accessible to the service. There are two types of data input. The
    Blob Storage URI can point to an Azure Blob<br>Storage folder that contains
    multiple CSV files, where each CSV file has<br>two columns, time stamp and
    variable. Or the Blob Storage URI can point to a single blob that contains a
    CSV file that has all the variables and a<br>time stamp column.<br>The model
    object will be created and returned in the response, but the<br>training
    process happens asynchronously. To check the training status,
    call<br>GetMultivariateModel with the modelId value and check the status
    field in the<br>modelInfo object.
