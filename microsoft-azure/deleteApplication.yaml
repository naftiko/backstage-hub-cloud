  description: >-
    An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an
    application will delete all services that are part of that application. By
    default, Service Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful
    manner and then delete the service. However, if a service is having issues
    closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or
    get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close
    sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of its services.
