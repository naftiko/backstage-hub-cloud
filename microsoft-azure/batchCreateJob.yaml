    The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a
    Job.In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The Batch
    servicelaunches this Task when it is ready to start the Job. The Job Manager
    Taskcontrols all other Tasks that run under this Job, by using the Task
    APIs. Inthe second approach, the user directly controls the execution of
    Tasks under anactive Job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming
    Jobs, avoidincluding sensitive information such as user names or secret
    project names.This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to
    Microsoft Supportengineers.
