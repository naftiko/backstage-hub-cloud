  name: Triggers Backup Of The Partition's State.
  description: >-
    Creates a backup of the stateful persisted partition's state. In case the
    partition is already being periodically backed up, then by default the new
    backup is created at the same backup storage. One can also override the same
    by specifying the backup storage details as part of the request body. Once
    the backup is initiated, its progress can be tracked using the
    GetBackupProgress operation. In case, the operation times out, specify a
    greater backup timeout value in the query parameter.
