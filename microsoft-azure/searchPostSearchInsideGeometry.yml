    **Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.The Search Geometry endpoint allows
    you to perform a free form search inside a single geometry or many of them.
    The search results that fall inside the geometry/geometries will be
    returned.To send the geometry you will use a `POST` request where the
    request body will contain the `geometry` object represented as a `GeoJSON`
    type and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. The
    geographical features to be searched can be modeled as Polygon and/or Circle
    geometries represented using any one of the following `GeoJSON`
    types:**GeoJSON FeatureCollection** The `geometry` can be represented as a
    `GeoJSON FeatureCollection` object. This is the recommended option if the
    geometry contains both Polygons and Circles. The `FeatureCollection` can
    contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Feature` objects. Each `Feature` object should
    represent either a Polygon or a Circle with the following conditions:A
    `Feature` object for the Polygon geometry can have a max of 50 coordinates
    and it's properties must be empty.A `Feature` object for the Circle geometry
    is composed of a _center_ represented using a `GeoJSON Point` type and a
    _radius_ value (in meters) which must be specified in the object's
    properties along with the _subType_ property whose value should be 'Circle'.
    Please see the Examples section below for a sample `FeatureCollection`
    representation.**GeoJSON GeometryCollection**The `geometry` can be
    represented as a `GeoJSON GeometryCollection` object. This is the
    recommended option if the geometry contains a list of Polygons only. The
    `GeometryCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Polygon` objects. Each
    `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see the Examples
    section below for a sample `GeometryCollection` representation.**GeoJSON
    Polygon**The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON Polygon` object.
    This is the recommended option if the geometry contains a single Polygon.
    The `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see the
    Examples section below for a sample `Polygon` representation..
