    **Applies to:** S1 pricing tier.<br><br><br>This API allows the caller to
    download a previously uploaded data content.<br>You can use this API in a
    scenario like downloading an existing collection of geofences uploaded
    previously using the [Data Upload
    API](/rest/api/maps/data/upload?view=rest-maps-1.0) for use in our [Azure
    Maps Geofencing Service](/rest/api/maps/spatial).<br><br>> [!NOTE]<br>><br>>
    **Azure Maps Data service retirement**<br>><br>> The Azure Maps Data service
    (both [v1](/rest/api/maps/data?view=rest-maps-1.0) and
    [v2](/rest/api/maps/data)) is now deprecated and will be retired on 9/16/24.
    To avoid service disruptions, all calls to the Data service will need to be
    updated to use the Azure Maps [Data Registry](/rest/api/maps/data-registry)
    service by 9/16/24. For more information, see [How to create data
    registry](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-create-data-registries).<br><br><br>###
    Submit Download Request<br><br>To download your content you will use a `GET`
    request where the path will contain the `udid` of the data to download.
    Optionally, you can also pass in an `Accept` header to specify a preference
    for the `Content-Type` of the data response. <br>For example, to download a
    collection of geofences previously uploaded using the Upload API, set the
    `udid` parameter in the path to the `udid` of the data received previously
    in the upload API response and set the `Accept` header to either one of the
    following media types: <br>    <br>  - `application/json`<br>  -
    `application/vnd.geo+json`<br>  - `application/octet-stream`<br><br><br>###
    Download Data Response<br><br>The Download API will return a HTTP `200 OK`
    response if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is found, where the
    response body will contain the content of the data resource.<br>A HTTP `400
    Bad Request` error response will be returned if the data resource with the
    passed-in `udid` is not found.<br><br>Here's a sample response body for a
    simple geofence represented in `GeoJSON` uploaded previously using the
    Upload API:<br><br><br>```json<br>{<br>    "type":
    "FeatureCollection",<br>    "features": [{<br>        "type":
    "Feature",<br>        "geometry": {<br>            "type":
    "Point",<br>            "coordinates": [-122.126986, 47.639754]<br>
