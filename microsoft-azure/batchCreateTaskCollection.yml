    Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return
    theresults for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in
    thisrequest. If the server times out or the connection is closed during
    therequest, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not
    at all.In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is
    up to theuser to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For
    example, youshould use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the prior
    operationsucceeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks unexpectedly. If
    the responsecontains any Tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the
    request. In aretry, it is most efficient to resubmit only Tasks that failed
    to add, and toomit Tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt.
    The maximumlifetime of a Task from addition to completion is 180 days. If a
    Task has notcompleted within 180 days of being added it will be terminated
    by the Batchservice and left in whatever state it was in at that time.
