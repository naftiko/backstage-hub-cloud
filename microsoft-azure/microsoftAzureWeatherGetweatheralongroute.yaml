    **Get Weather along route**<br>   <br>   <br> **Applies to**: S1 pricing
    tier.<br><br> Weather along a route API returns hyper local (one kilometer
    or less), up-to-the-minute weather nowcasts, weather hazard assessments, and
    notifications along a route described as a sequence of waypoints. <br> This
    includes a list of weather hazards affecting the waypoint or route, and the
    aggregated hazard index for each waypoint might be used to paint each
    portion of a route according to how safe it is for the driver. When
    submitting the waypoints, it is recommended to stay within, or close to, the
    distance that can be traveled within 120-mins or shortly after. Data is
    updated every five minutes. <br> <br> The service supplements Azure Maps
    [Route Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route) that allows
    you to first request a route between an origin and a destination and use
    that as an input for Weather Along Route endpoint.<br> <br> In addition, the
    service supports scenarios to generate weather notifications for waypoints
    that experience an increase in intensity of a weather hazard. For example,
    if the vehicle is expected to begin experiencing heavy rain as it reaches a
    waypoint, a weather notification for heavy rain will be generated for that
    waypoint allowing the end product to display a heavy rain notification
    before the driver reaches that waypoint. <br> The trigger for when to
    display the notification for a waypoint could be based, for example, on a
    [geofence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/tutorial-iot-hub-maps),
    or selectable distance to the waypoint.<br><br> The API covers all regions
    of the planet except latitudes above Greenland and Antarctica.
