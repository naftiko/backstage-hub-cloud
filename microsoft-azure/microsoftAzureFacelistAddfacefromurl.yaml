    Add a face to a specified face list, up to 1,000 faces.<br> To deal with an
    image contains multiple faces, input face can be specified as an image with
    a targetFace rectangle. It returns a persistedFaceId representing the added
    face. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be
    stored on server until [FaceList - Delete
    Face](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/facelist/deleteface) or

    Higher face image quality means better detection and recognition precision.
    Please consider high-quality faces: frontal, clear, and face size is 200x200
    pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.<br>* JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first
    frame), and BMP format are supported. The allowed image file size is from
    1KB to 6MB.<br>* "targetFace" rectangle should contain one face. Zero or
    multiple faces will be regarded as an error. If the provided "targetFace"
    rectangle is not returned from [Face -
    Detect](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl),
    there’s no guarantee to detect and add the face successfully.<br>* Out of
    detectable face size (36x36 - 4096x4096 pixels), large head-pose, or large
    occlusions will cause failures.<br>* Adding/deleting faces to/from a same
    face list are processed sequentially and to/from different face lists are in
    parallel.<br>* The minimum detectable face size is 36x36 pixels in an image
    no larger than 1920x1080 pixels. Images with dimensions higher than
    1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.<br>*
