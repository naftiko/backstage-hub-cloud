    The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a
    Job.<br>In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The
    Batch service<br>launches this Task when it is ready to start the Job. The
    Job Manager Task<br>controls all other Tasks that run under this Job, by
    using the Task APIs. In<br>the second approach, the user directly controls
    the execution of Tasks under an<br>active Job, by using the Task APIs. Also
    note: when naming Jobs, avoid<br>including sensitive information such as
    user names or secret project names.<br>This information may appear in
    telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft Support<br>engineers.
