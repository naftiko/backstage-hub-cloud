    When a Terminate Job request is received, the Batch service sets the Job to
    the terminating state. The Batch service then terminates any running Tasks
    associated with the Job and runs any required Job release Tasks. Then the
    Job moves into the completed state. If there are any Tasks in the Job in the
    active state, they will remain in the active state. Once a Job is
    terminated, new Tasks cannot be added and any remaining active Tasks will
    not be scheduled.
