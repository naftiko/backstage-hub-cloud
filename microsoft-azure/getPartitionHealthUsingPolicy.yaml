    Gets the health information of the specified partition.If the application
    health policy is specified, the health evaluation uses it to get the
    aggregated health state.If the policy is not specified, the health
    evaluation uses the application health policy defined in the application
    manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in the
    manifest.Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health
    events reported on the partition based on the health state.Use
    ReplicasHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of ReplicaHealthState
    objects on the partition. Use ApplicationHealthPolicy in the POST body to
    override the health policies used to evaluate the health.If you specify a
    partition that does not exist in the health store, this request returns an
    error.
