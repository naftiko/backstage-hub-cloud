  description: >-
    Returns the status for all documents in a batch document translation
    request.            If the number of documents in the response exceeds our
    paging limit, server-side paging is used.Paginated responses indicate a
    partial result and include a continuation token in the response. The absence
    of a continuation token means that no additional pages are
    available.            $top, $skip and $maxpagesize query parameters can be
    used to specify a number of results to return and an offset for the
    collection.            $top indicates the total number of records the user
    wants to be returned across all pages.$skip indicates the number of records
    to skip from the list of document status held by the server based on the
    sorting method specified.  By default, we sort by descending start
    time.$maxpagesize is the maximum items returned in a page.  If more items
    are requested via $top (or $top is not specified and there are more items to
    be returned), @nextLink will contain the link to the next page.           
    $orderBy query parameter can be used to sort the returned list (ex
    "$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc asc" or "$orderBy=createdDateTimeUtc desc").The
    default sorting is descending by createdDateTimeUtc.Some query parameters
    can be used to filter the returned list (ex: "status=Succeeded,Cancelled")
    will only return succeeded and cancelled documents.createdDateTimeUtcStart
    and createdDateTimeUtcEnd can be used combined or separately to specify a
    range of datetime to filter the returned list by.The supported filtering
    query parameters are (status, ids, createdDateTimeUtcStart,
    createdDateTimeUtcEnd).            When both $top and $skip are included,
    the server should first apply $skip and then $top on the collection.Note: If
    the server can't honor $top and/or $skip, the server must return an error to
    the client informing about it instead of just ignoring the query
    options.This reduces the risk of the client making assumptions about the
    data returned.
