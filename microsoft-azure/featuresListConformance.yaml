    The Features API is a part of
    [Creator](/azure/azure-maps/creator-indoor-maps), which makes it possible to
    develop applications based on your private indoor map data using Azure Maps
    API and SDK. Features GET APIs follow the [Open Geospatial Consortium API -
    Features - Part 1: Core
    corrigendum](http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0.1) standard
    to query [Datasets](/rest/api/maps-creator/dataset). Datasets consist of
    multiple feature collections, which are a grouping of
    [features](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) defined by a
    common schema. ### Submit List Conformance RequestThe `List Conformance` API
    is an HTTP `GET` request that returns a list of all requirements classes
    specified in the OGC standard that the server conforms to.
