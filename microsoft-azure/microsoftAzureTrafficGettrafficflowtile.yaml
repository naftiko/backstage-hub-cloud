    __Traffic Flow Tile__<br><br><br>**Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing
    tiers.<br><br>The Azure Flow Tile API serves 256 x 256 pixel tiles showing
    traffic flow. All tiles use the same grid system. Because the traffic tiles
    use transparent images, they can be layered on top of map tiles to create a
    compound  display. The Flow tiles use colors to indicate either the speed of
    traffic on different road segments, or the difference between that speed and
    the free-flow speed on the road segment in question.
