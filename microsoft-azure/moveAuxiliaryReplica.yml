  name: Moves The Auxiliary Replica Of A Partition Of A Stateful Service.
  description: >-
    This command moves the auxiliary replica of a partition of a stateful
    service, respecting all constraints.CurrentNodeName can be omitted, and in
    that case a random auxiliary replica is chosen.NewNodeName can be omitted,
    and in that case the auxiliary replica is moved to a random node.If
    IgnoreConstraints parameter is specified and set to true, then auxiliary
    will be moved regardless of the constraints.
