    Submit an operation to apply a snapshot to current subscription. For each
    snapshot, only subscriptions included in the applyScope of Snapshot - Take
    can apply it.The snapshot interfaces are for users to backup and restore
    their face data from one face subscription to another, inside same region or
    across regions. The workflow contains two phases, user first calls Snapshot
    - Take to create a copy of the source object and store it as a snapshot,
    then calls Snapshot - Apply to paste the snapshot to target subscription.
    The snapshots are stored in a centralized location (per Azure instance), so
    that they can be applied cross accounts and regions.Applying snapshot is an
    asynchronous operation. An operation id can be obtained from the
    "Operation-Location" field in response header, to be used in OperationStatus
    - Get for tracking the progress of applying the snapshot. The target object
    id will be included in the "resourceLocation" field in OperationStatus - Get
    response when the operation status is "succeeded".Snapshot applying time
    depends on the number of person and face entries in the snapshot object. It
    could be in seconds, or up to 1 hour for 1,000,000 persons with multiple
    faces.Snapshots will be automatically expired and cleaned in 48 hours after
    it is created by Snapshot - Take. So the target subscription is required to
    apply the snapshot in 48 hours since its creation.Applying a snapshot will
    not block any other operations against the target object, however it is not
    recommended because the correctness cannot be guaranteed during snapshot
    applying. After snapshot applying is completed, all operations towards the
    target object can work as normal. Snapshot also includes the training
    results of the source object, which means target subscription the snapshot
    applied to does not need re-train the target object before calling
    Identify/FindSimilar.One snapshot can be applied multiple times in parallel,
    while currently only CreateNew apply mode is supported, which means the
    apply operation will fail if target subscription already contains an object
    of same type and using the same objectId. Users can specify the "objectId"
    in request body to avoid such conflicts.* Free-tier subscription quota: 100
    apply operations per month.* S0-tier subscription quota: 100 apply
    operations per day.
