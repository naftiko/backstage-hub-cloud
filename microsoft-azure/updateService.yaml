    This API allows updating properties of a running Service Fabric service. The
    set of properties that can be updated are a subset of the properties that
    were specified at the time of creating the service. The current set of
    properties can be obtained using `GetServiceDescription` API. Note that
    updating the properties of a running service is different than upgrading
    your application using `StartApplicationUpgrade` API. The upgrade is a long
    running background operation that involves moving the application from one
    version to another, one upgrade domain at a time, whereas update applies the
    new properties immediately to the service.
