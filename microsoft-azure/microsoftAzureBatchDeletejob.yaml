    Deleting a Job also deletes all Tasks that are part of that Job, and all
    Job<br>statistics. This also overrides the retention period for Task data;
    that is, if<br>the Job contains Tasks which are still retained on Compute
    Nodes, the Batch<br>services deletes those Tasks' working directories and
    all their contents.  When<br>a Delete Job request is received, the Batch
    service sets the Job to the<br>deleting state. All update operations on a
    Job that is in deleting state will<br>fail with status code 409 (Conflict),
    with additional information indicating<br>that the Job is being deleted.
