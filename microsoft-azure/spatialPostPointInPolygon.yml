  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.This API returns a boolean value indicating
    whether a point is inside a set of polygons. The user data may contain
    Polygon and MultiPolygon geometries, other geometries will be ignored if
    provided. If the point is inside or on the boundary of one of these
    polygons, the value returned is true. In all other cases, the value returned
    is false. When the point is inside multiple polygons, the result will give
    intersecting geometries section to show all valid geometries (referenced by
    geometryId) in user data. The maximum number of vertices accepted to form a
    Polygon is 10,000.
