    You can only resize a Pool when its allocation state is steady. If the Pool
    isalready resizing, the request fails with status code 409. When you resize
    aPool, the Pool's allocation state changes from steady to resizing. You
    cannotresize Pools which are configured for automatic scaling. If you try to
    do this,the Batch service returns an error 409. If you resize a Pool
    downwards, theBatch service chooses which Compute Nodes to remove. To remove
    specific ComputeNodes, use the Pool remove Compute Nodes API instead.
