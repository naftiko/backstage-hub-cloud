    possible to develop applications based on your private indoor map data using
    Azure Maps API and SDK.

    Creator.<br><br>The Conversion API lets the caller import a set of DWG
    design files as a zipped [Drawing
    Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) into Azure Maps. The [Drawing
    Package](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-package) should first be uploaded using
    the [Azure Maps Data
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data). Once uploaded, use
    the `udid` returned by the [Data Upload
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data-v2/upload-preview) to
    call this Conversion API.<br><br>## Convert DWG package<br><br>The
    Conversion API performs a [long-running
    operation](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2).<br><br>## Debug DWG package
    issues<br><br><br>During the Conversion process, if there are any issues
    with the DWG package [errors and
    warnings](https://aka.ms/am-conversion-errors) are provided in the response
    along with a *diagnostic package* to visualize and diagnose these issues. In
    case any issues are encountered with your DWG package, the Conversion
    operation status process as detailed
    [here](https://aka.ms/am-creator-lrt-v2) returns the location of the
    *diagnostic package* that can be downloaded by the caller to help them
    visualize and diagnose these issues. The *diagnostic package* location can
    be found in the properties section of the conversion operation status
    response and looks like the following:<br><br>```json<br>{<br>   
    "properties": {<br>        "diagnosticPackageLocation":
    "https://us.atlas.microsoft.com/mapdata/{DiagnosticPackageId}?api-version=1.0"               
    <br>    }            <br>}<br>```<br><br>The *diagnostic package* can be
    downloaded by executing a `HTTP GET` request on the
    `diagnosticPackageLocation`.<br>For more details on how to use the tool to
    visualize and diagnose all the errors and warnings see [Drawing Error
    Visualizer](https://aka.ms/am-drawing-errors-visualizer). <br><br>A
    conversion operation will be marked as *success* if there are zero or more
    warnings but will be marked as *failed* if any errors are encountered.
