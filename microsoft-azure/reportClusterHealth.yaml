    Sends a health report on a Service Fabric cluster. The report must contain
    the information about the source of the health report and property on which
    it is reported.The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which
    forwards to the health store.The report may be accepted by the gateway, but
    rejected by the health store after extra validation.For example, the health
    store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale
    sequence number.To see whether the report was applied in the health store,
    run GetClusterHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents
    section.
