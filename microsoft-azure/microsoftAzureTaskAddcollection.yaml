    Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return
    the results for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in this
    request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during the
    request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or not at
    all. In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note that it is up
    to the user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a request. For
    example, you should use the same Task IDs during a retry so that if the
    prior operation succeeded, the retry will not create extra Tasks
    unexpectedly. If the response contains any Tasks which failed to add, a
    client can retry the request. In a retry, it is most efficient to resubmit
    only Tasks that failed to add, and to omit Tasks that were successfully
    added on the first attempt. The maximum lifetime of a Task from addition to
    completion is 180 days. If a Task has not completed within 180 days of being
    added it will be terminated by the Batch service and left in whatever state
    it was in at that time.
