    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.This API returns a FeatureCollection where
    each Feature is a buffer around the corresponding indexed Feature of the
    input. The buffer could be either on the outside or the inside of the
    provided Feature, depending on the distance provided in the input. There
    must be either one distance provided per Feature in the FeatureCollection 
    input, or if only one distance is provided, then that distance is applied to
    every Feature in the collection. The positive (or negative) buffer of a
    geometry is defined as the Minkowski sum (or difference) of the geometry
    with a circle of radius equal to the absolute value of the buffer distance.
    The buffer API always returns a polygonal result. The negative or
    zero-distance buffer of lines and points is always an empty polygon. The
    input may contain a collection of Point, MultiPoint, Polygon, MultiPolygon,
    LineString and MultiLineString. GeometryCollection will be ignored if
    provided.
