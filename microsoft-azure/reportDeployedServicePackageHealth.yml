  name: Sends A Health Report On The Service Fabric Deployed Service Package.
  description: >-
    Reports health state of the service package of the application deployed on a
    Service Fabric node. The report must contain the information about the
    source of the health report and property on which it is reported.The report
    is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Service, which forwards to the health
    store.The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health
    store after extra validation.For example, the health store may reject the
    report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number.To see
    whether the report was applied in the health store, get deployed service
    package health and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents
    section.
