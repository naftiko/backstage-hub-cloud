    Deletes a device class. Device classes are created automatically when Device
    Update-enabled devices are connected to the hub but are not automatically
    cleaned up since they are referenced by DeviceClassSubgroups. If the user
    has deleted all DeviceClassSubgroups for a device class they can also delete
    the device class to remove the records from the system and to stop checking
    the compatibility of this device class with new updates. If a device is ever
    reconnected for this device class it will be re-created.
