    Enables periodic backup of stateful partitions which are part of this
    Service Fabric service. Each partition is backed up individually as per the
    specified backup policy description. In case the application, which the
    service is part of, is already enabled for backup then this operation would
    override the policy being used to take the periodic backup for this service
    and its partitions (unless explicitly overridden at the partition
    level).<br>Note only C# based Reliable Actor and Reliable Stateful services
    are currently supported for periodic backup.
