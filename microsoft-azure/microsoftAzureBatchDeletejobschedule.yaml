    When you delete a Job Schedule, this also deletes all Jobs and Tasks under
    that<br>schedule. When Tasks are deleted, all the files in their working
    directories on<br>the Compute Nodes are also deleted (the retention period
    is ignored). The Job<br>Schedule statistics are no longer accessible once
    the Job Schedule is deleted,<br>though they are still counted towards
    Account lifetime statistics.
