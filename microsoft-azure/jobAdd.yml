  description: >-
    The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a
    Job. In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The Batch
    service launches this Task when it is ready to start the Job. The Job
    Manager Task controls all other Tasks that run under this Job, by using the
    Task APIs. In the second approach, the user directly controls the execution
    of Tasks under an active Job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming
    Jobs, avoid including sensitive information such as user names or secret
    project names. This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to
    Microsoft Support engineers.
