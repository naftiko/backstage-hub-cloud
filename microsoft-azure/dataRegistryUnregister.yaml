    registry without deleting the underlying content from the Azure storage
    account.Useful in scenarios like unregistering geofence files previously
    registered using the [Register or
    Replace](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/data-registry/register-or-replace)
    API for use in the [Azure Maps Geofencing
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/spatial), or unregistering
    a compressed (ZIP) file containing DWG design files used by the Azure Maps
    Creator [Conversion
    Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/v2/conversion).The data
    registry service endpoint is limited in scope to the region of your Azure
    Maps account and is not available for global Azure Maps accounts.## Submit
