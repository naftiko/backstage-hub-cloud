    This does not restore the Pool to its previous state before the
    resizeoperation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the Pool
    maintainsits current state. After stopping, the Pool stabilizes at the
    number of ComputeNodes it was at when the stop operation was done. During
    the stop operation,the Pool allocation state changes first to stopping and
    then to steady. Aresize operation need not be an explicit resize Pool
    request; this API can alsobe used to halt the initial sizing of the Pool
    when it is created.
