  name: Gets The List Of Application Types In The Service Fabric Cluster.
  description: >-
    Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or
    in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. Each
    version of an application type is returned as one application type. The
    response includes the name, version, status, and other details about the
    application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the
    application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as
    a continuation token, which can be used to get the next page. For example,
    if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first three
    application types, or if max results is set to 3, then three is returned. To
    access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the
    returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token
    is returned if there are no subsequent pages.
