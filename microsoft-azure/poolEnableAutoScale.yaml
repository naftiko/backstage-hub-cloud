    You cannot enable automatic scaling on a Pool if a resize operation is in
    progress on the Pool. If automatic scaling of the Pool is currently
    disabled, you must specify a valid autoscale formula as part of the request.
    If automatic scaling of the Pool is already enabled, you may specify a new
    autoscale formula and/or a new evaluation interval. You cannot call this API
    for the same Pool more than once every 30 seconds.
