  description: >-
    Submit a multivariate anomaly detection task with the modelId value of a
    trained modeland inference data. The input schema should be the same with
    the trainingrequest. The request will finish asynchronously and return a
    resultId value toquery the detection result. The request should be a source
    link to indicate anexternally accessible Azure Storage URI that either
    points to an Azure BlobStorage folder or points to a CSV file in Azure Blob
    Storage.
