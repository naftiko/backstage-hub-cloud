  description: >-
    When a Task is deleted, all of the files in its directory on the Compute
    Node where it ran are also deleted (regardless of the retention time). For
    multi-instance Tasks, the delete Task operation applies synchronously to the
    primary task; subtasks and their files are then deleted asynchronously in
    the background.
