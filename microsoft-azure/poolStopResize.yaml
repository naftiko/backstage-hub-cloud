    This does not restore the Pool to its previous state before the resize
    operation: it only stops any further changes being made, and the Pool
    maintains its current state. After stopping, the Pool stabilizes at the
    number of Compute Nodes it was at when the stop operation was done. During
    the stop operation, the Pool allocation state changes first to stopping and
    then to steady. A resize operation need not be an explicit resize Pool
    request; this API can also be used to halt the initial sizing of the Pool
    when it is created.

                which is not in the resizing state, the request fails with HTTP
