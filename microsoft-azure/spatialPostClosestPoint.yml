  name: Post Spatial Closestpoint Format
  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.This API returns the closest point between a
    base point and a given set of target points. The set of target points is
    provided by user data in post request body. The user data may only contain a
    collection of Point geometry. MultiPoint or other geometries will be ignored
    if provided. The algorithm does not take into account routing or traffic.
    The maximum number of points accepted is 100,000. Information returned
    includes closest point latitude, longitude, and distance in meters from the
    closest point.
