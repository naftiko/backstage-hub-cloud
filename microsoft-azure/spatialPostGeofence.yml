    **Search Geofence Post API****Applies to:** S1 Pricing tier.The Geofence
    Post API allows you to retrieve the proximity of a coordinate to a  provided
    geofence or set of fences. With POST call, you do not have to upload the
    fence data in advance, instead you supply the location of the object you are
    tracking in query parameters as well as the fence or set of fences data in
    post request body. See [Geofencing GeoJSON
    data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/geofence-geojson)
    for more details on the geofence data format. The response will contain
    information about the distance from the outer edge of the geofence. A
    negative value signifies that the  coordinate is inside of the fence while a
    positive value means that it is outside of the fence.This API can be used
    for a variety of scenarios that include things like asset  tracking, fleet
    management, or setting up alerts for moving objects.The API supports
    [integration with Event
    Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/azure-maps-event-grid-integration). 
    The isAsync parameter is used to enable integration with Event Grid
    (disabled by default).
