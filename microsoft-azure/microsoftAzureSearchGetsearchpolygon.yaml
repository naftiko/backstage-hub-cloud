    **Get Polygon**<br><br><br>**Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.<br><br><br>The
    Get Polygon service allows you to request the geometry data such as a city
    or country  outline for a set of entities, previously retrieved from an
    Online Search request in GeoJSON format. The geometry  ID is returned in the
    dataSources object under "geometry" and "id" in either a Search Address or
    Search Fuzzy call.<br><br>Please note that any geometry ID retrieved from an
    Online Search endpoint has a limited lifetime. The client  should not store
    geometry IDs in persistent storage for later referral, as the stability of
    these identifiers is  not guaranteed for a long period of time. It is
    expected that a request to the Polygon method is made within a  few minutes
    of the request to the Online Search method that provided the ID. The service
    allows for batch  requests up to 20 identifiers.
