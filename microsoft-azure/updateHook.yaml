    If the property secret in the configuration is omitted or contains an empty
    string, future callbacks won't contain
    X-MicrosoftSpeechServices-Signatureheaders. If the property contains a
    non-empty string, it will be used to create a SHA256 hash of the payload
    with the secret as HMAC key. This hashwill be set as
    X-MicrosoftSpeechServices-Signature header when calling back into the
    registered URL.            If the URL changes,  the web hook will stop
    receiving events until achallenge/response is completed. To do this, a
    request with the event type challenge will be made with a query parameter
    called validationToken.Respond to the challenge with a 200 OK containing the
    value of the validationToken query parameter as the response body. When the
    challenge/responseis successfully completed, the web hook will begin
    receiving events.
