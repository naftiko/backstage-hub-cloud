    This API provides a way to download code packages including the container
    images on a specific node outside of the normal application deployment and
    upgrade path. This is useful for the large code packages and container
    images to be present on the node before the actual application deployment
    and upgrade, thus significantly reducing the total time required for the
    deployment or upgrade.
