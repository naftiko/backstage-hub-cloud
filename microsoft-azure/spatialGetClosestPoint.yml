  name: Get Spatial Closestpoint Format
  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S1 pricing tier.This API returns the closest point between a
    base point and a given set of points in the user uploaded data set
    identified by udid. The set of target points is provided by a GeoJSON file
    which is uploaded via [Data Upload
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and
    referenced by a unique udid. The GeoJSON file may only contain a collection
    of Point geometry. MultiPoint or other geometries will be ignored if
    provided. The maximum number of points accepted is 100,000. The algorithm
    does not take into account routing or traffic. Information returned includes
    closest point latitude, longitude, and distance in meters from the closest
    point.To test this API, you can upload the sample data from [Post Closest
    Point
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/postclosestpoint#examples)
    examples (Request Body) via [Data Upload
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/data/uploadPreview) and
    replace the `{udid}` from the [sample request
    below](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/spatial/getclosestpoint#examples)
    with the udid returned by Data Upload API.
