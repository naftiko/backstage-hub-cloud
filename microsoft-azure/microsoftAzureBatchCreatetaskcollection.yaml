    Note that each Task must have a unique ID. The Batch service may not return
    the<br>results for each Task in the same order the Tasks were submitted in
    this<br>request. If the server times out or the connection is closed during
    the<br>request, the request may have been partially or fully processed, or
    not at all.<br>In such cases, the user should re-issue the request. Note
    that it is up to the<br>user to correctly handle failures when re-issuing a
    request. For example, you<br>should use the same Task IDs during a retry so
    that if the prior operation<br>succeeded, the retry will not create extra
    Tasks unexpectedly. If the response<br>contains any Tasks which failed to
    add, a client can retry the request. In a<br>retry, it is most efficient to
    resubmit only Tasks that failed to add, and to<br>omit Tasks that were
    successfully added on the first attempt. The maximum<br>lifetime of a Task
    from addition to completion is 180 days. If a Task has not<br>completed
    within 180 days of being added it will be terminated by the Batch<br>service
    and left in whatever state it was in at that time.
