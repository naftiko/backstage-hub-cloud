    article introduces concepts and tools that apply to Azure Maps Creator.This
    API allows the caller to fetch a previously successfully created dataset.###
    Submit Get Details RequestTo get the details for a previously created
    dataset, you will issue a `GET` request with the `datasetId` in the path.###
    Get Details ResponseThe Get Details API returns the details for a dataset in
    `json` format. The response contains the following fields (if they are not
    null or empty):> created - The timestamp the dataset was created.> datasetId
    - The id for the dataset.> description - The description for the dataset.>
    datasetSources - The source data that was used when the create request was
    issued.> ontology - The source
    [ontology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/creator-facility-ontology)
    that was used in the conversion service for the input data.The
    `datasetSources` describes the source data that was used when the create
    request was issued and contains the following elements (if they are not null
    or empty):> conversionIds - The list of `conversionId` (null if none were
    provided).> appendDatasetId - The `datasetId` that was used for an append
    operation (null if none was used).>featureCounts - The counts for each
    feature type in the dataset.Here's a sample response returning the
    `timestamp`, `datasetId`, `description`, `datasetSources`, and `ontology` of
    a dataset resource:```json{   "timestamp": "2020-01-01T22:50:48.123Z",  
    "datasetId": "f6495f62-94f8-0ec2-c252-45626f82fcb2",   "description": "Some
    description or comment for the dataset.",   "datasetSources": {    
    "conversionIds": [       "15d21452-c9bb-27b6-5e79-743ca5c3205d"     ],
