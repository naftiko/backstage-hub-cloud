  description: >-
    **Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.The Search Along Route endpoint
    allows you to perform a fuzzy search for POIs along a specified route. This
    search is constrained by specifying the `maxDetourTime` limiting measure.To
    send the route-points you will use a `POST` request where the request body
    will contain the `route` object represented as a `GeoJSON LineString` type
    and the `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. Each
    route-point in `route` is represented as a `GeoJSON Position` type i.e. an
    array where the _longitude_ value is followed by the _latitude_ value and
    the _altitude_ value is ignored. The `route` should contain at least 2
    route-points.It is possible that original route will be altered, some of
    it's points may be skipped. If the route that passes through the found point
    is faster than the original one, the `detourTime` value in the response is
    negative.
