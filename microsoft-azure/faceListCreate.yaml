    Create an empty face list with user-specified faceListId, name, an optional
    userData and recognitionModel. Up to 64 face lists are allowed in one
    subscription. Face list is a list of faces, up to 1,000 faces, and used by
    [Face - Find
    Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/findsimilar).
    After creation, user should use [FaceList - Add
    Face](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/facelist/addfacefromurl)
    to import the faces. No image will be stored. Only the extracted face
    features are stored on server until [FaceList -
    Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/facelist/delete) is
    called. Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like faces,
    similar face filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the
    actual use is to identify person, please use
    [PersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroup) /
    [LargePersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largepersongroup)
    and [Face -
    Identify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/identify). Please
    consider
    [LargeFaceList](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist)
    when the face number is large. It can support up to 1,000,000
    faces.'recognitionModel' should be specified to associate with this face
    list. The default value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the
    latest model needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this
    parameter. New faces that are added to an existing face list will use the
    recognition model that's already associated with the collection. Existing
    face features in a face list can't be updated to features extracted by
    another version of recognition model.Please Refer to [Specify a face
    recognition
    model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/specify-recognition-model).
