  description: >-
    Reactivation makes a Task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum
    retrycount. The Task's state is changed to active. As the Task is no longer
    in thecompleted state, any previous exit code or failure information is no
    longeravailable after reactivation. Each time a Task is reactivated, its
    retry countis reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for Tasks that are not
    completed or thatpreviously completed successfully (with an exit code of 0).
    Additionally, itwill fail if the Job has completed (or is terminating or
