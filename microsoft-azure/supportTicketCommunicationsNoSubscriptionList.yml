    communication supported today is _Web_. Output will be a paged result with
    _nextLink_, using which you can retrieve the next set of Communication
    results. Support ticket data is available for 18 months after ticket
    creation. If a ticket was created more than 18 months ago, a request for
    data might cause an error.
