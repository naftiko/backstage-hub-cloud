    delete a previously uploaded data content.    <br>You can use this API in a
    scenario like removing geofences previously uploaded using the [Data Upload
    API](/rest/api/maps/data/upload?view=rest-maps-1.0) for use in our [Azure
    Maps Geofencing Service](/rest/api/maps/spatial). You can also use this API
    to delete old/unused uploaded content and create space for new
    content.<br><br>> [!NOTE]<br>><br>> **Azure Maps Data service

    [v1](/rest/api/maps/data?view=rest-maps-1.0) and [v2](/rest/api/maps/data))
    is now deprecated and will be retired on 9/16/24. To avoid service
    disruptions, all calls to the Data service will need to be updated to use
    the Azure Maps [Data Registry](/rest/api/maps/data-registry) service by
    9/16/24. For more information, see [How to create data
    registry](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-create-data-registries).<br><br><br>###
    Submit Delete Request<br><br>To delete your content you will issue a
    `DELETE` request where the path will contain the `udid` of the data to
    delete.    <br>For example, to delete a collection of geofences previously
    uploaded using the Upload API, set the `udid` parameter in the path to the
    `udid` of the data received previously in the upload API response.
    <br><br><br>### Delete Data Response<br><br>The Data Delete API returns a
    HTTP `204 No Content` response with an empty body, if the data resource was
    deleted successfully.    <br>A HTTP `400 Bad Request` error response will be
    returned if the data resource with the passed-in `udid` is not found.
