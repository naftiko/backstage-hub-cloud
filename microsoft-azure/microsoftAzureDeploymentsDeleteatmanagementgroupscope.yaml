    A template deployment that is currently running cannot be deleted. Deleting
    a template deployment removes the associated deployment operations. This is
    an asynchronous operation that returns a status of 202 until the template
    deployment is successfully deleted. The Location response header contains
    the URI that is used to obtain the status of the process. While the process
    is running, a call to the URI in the Location header returns a status of
    202. When the process finishes, the URI in the Location header returns a
    status of 204 on success. If the asynchronous request failed, the URI in the
    Location header returns an error-level status code.
