  description: >-
    Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster using health chunks. The health
    evaluation is done based on the input cluster health chunk query
    description.The query description allows users to specify health policies
    for evaluating the cluster and its children.Users can specify very flexible
    filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be
    done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.The query
    can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified
    filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name,
    and for this application, returnonly services that are in Error or Warning,
    and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.
