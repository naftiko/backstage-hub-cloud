    API and SDK. Features GET APIs follow the [Open Geospatial Consortium API -

    corrigendum](http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0.1) standard
    to query [Datasets](/rest/api/maps-creator/dataset). Datasets consist of
    multiple feature collections, which are a grouping of
    [features](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2) defined by a
    common schema.### Submit Replace RequestThe `Replace` API is an HTTP `PUT`
    request that **replaces** the feature identified by the provided `featureId`
    in the specified collection, meaning the data supplied in the request body
    overwrites all attributes of the feature.
