  name: Deletes An Existing Service Fabric Service.
  description: >-
    A service must be created before it can be deleted. By default, Service
    Fabric will try to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then
    delete the service. However, if the service is having issues closing the
    replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck.
    Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and
    forcefully delete the service.
