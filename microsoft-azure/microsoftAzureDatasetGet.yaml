    Creator.<br><br>This API allows the caller to fetch a previously
    successfully created dataset.<br><br>### Submit Get Details
    Request<br><br>To get the details for a previously created dataset, you will
    issue a `GET` request with the `datasetId` in the path.<br><br>### Get
    Details Response<br><br>The Get Details API returns the details for a
    dataset in `json` format. The response contains the following fields (if
    they are not null or empty):<br>> created - The timestamp the dataset was
    created.<br>> datasetId - The id for the dataset.<br>> description - The
    description for the dataset.<br>> datasetSources - The source data that was
    used when the create request was issued.<br>> ontology - The source
    [ontology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/creator-facility-ontology)
    that was used in the conversion service for the input data.<br><br>The
    `datasetSources` describes the source data that was used when the create
    request was issued and contains the following elements (if they are not null
    or empty):<br>> conversionIds - The list of `conversionId` (null if none
    were provided).<br>> appendDatasetId - The `datasetId` that was used for an
    append operation (null if none was used).<br>>featureCounts - The counts for
    each feature type in the dataset.<br><br>Here's a sample response returning
    the `timestamp`, `datasetId`, `description`, `datasetSources`, and
    `ontology` of a dataset resource:<br><br>```json<br>{<br>   "timestamp":
    "2020-01-01T22:50:48.123Z",<br>   "datasetId":
