    Gets the list of applications deployed on a Service Fabric node. The results
    do not include information about deployed system applications unless
    explicitly queried for by ID. Results encompass deployed applications in
    active, activating, and downloading states. This query requires that the
    node name corresponds to a node on the cluster. The query fails if the
    provided node name does not point to any active Service Fabric nodes on the
    cluster.
