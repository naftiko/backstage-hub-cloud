    Reactivation makes a Task eligible to be retried again up to its maximum
    retry<br>count. The Task's state is changed to active. As the Task is no
    longer in the<br>completed state, any previous exit code or failure
    information is no longer<br>available after reactivation. Each time a Task
    is reactivated, its retry count<br>is reset to 0. Reactivation will fail for
    Tasks that are not completed or that<br>previously completed successfully
    (with an exit code of 0). Additionally, it<br>will fail if the Job has
    completed (or is terminating or deleting).
