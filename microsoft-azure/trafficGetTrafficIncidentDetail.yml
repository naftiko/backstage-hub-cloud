    __Traffic Incident Detail__ **Applies to**: S0 and S1 pricing tiers.This API
    provides information on traffic incidents inside a given bounding box, based
    on the current Traffic  Model ID. The Traffic Model ID is available to grant
    synchronization of data between calls and API's. The  Traffic Model ID is a
    key value for determining the currency of traffic incidents. It is updated
    every minute,  and is valid for two minutes before it times out. It is used
    in rendering  [incident
    tiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/traffic/gettrafficincidenttile).
    It can be  obtained from the [Viewport
    API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/traffic/gettrafficincidentviewport).
