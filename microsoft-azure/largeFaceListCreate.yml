    Create an empty large face list with user-specified largeFaceListId, name,
    an optional userData and recognitionModel. Large face list is a list of
    faces, up to 1,000,000 faces, and used by [Face - Find
    Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/findsimilar).
    After creation, user should use [LargeFaceList Face -
    Add](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/addfacefromurl)
    to import the faces and [LargeFaceList -
    Train](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/train) to
    make it ready for [Face - Find
    Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/findsimilar). No
    image will be stored. Only the extracted face features are stored on server
    until [LargeFaceList -
    Delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/delete) is
    called. Find Similar is used for scenario like finding celebrity-like faces,
    similar face filtering, or as a light way face identification. But if the
    actual use is to identify person, please use
    [PersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/persongroup) /
    [LargePersonGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largepersongroup)
    and [Face -
    Identify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/identify).'recognitionModel'
    should be specified to associate with this large face list. The default
    value for 'recognitionModel' is 'recognition_01', if the latest model
    needed, please explicitly specify the model you need in this parameter. New
    faces that are added to an existing large face list will use the recognition
    model that's already associated with the collection. Existing face features
    in a large face list can't be updated to features extracted by another
    version of recognition model. Please refer to [Specify a recognition
    model](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/specify-recognition-model).Large
    face list quota:* Free-tier subscription quota: 64 large face lists.*
    S0-tier subscription quota: 1,000,000 large face lists.
