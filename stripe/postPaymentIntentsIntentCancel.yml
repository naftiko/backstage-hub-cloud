  name: Post Payment_intents Intent Cancel
  description: >-
    You can cancel a PaymentIntent object when it’s in one of these statuses:
    requires_payment_method, requires_capture, requires_confirmation,
    requires_action or, in rare cases, processing. After it’s canceled, no
    additional charges are made by the PaymentIntent and any operations on the
    PaymentIntent fail with an error. For PaymentIntents with a status of
    requires_capture, the remaining amount_capturable is automatically refunded.
    You can’t cancel the PaymentIntent for a Checkout Session. Expire the
    Checkout Session instead.
