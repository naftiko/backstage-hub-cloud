    When you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best first
    step. If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the
    dispute in your favor. You can do this in your dashboard, but if you prefer,
    you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.Depending on your
    dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of
    winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see
    our guide to dispute types.
