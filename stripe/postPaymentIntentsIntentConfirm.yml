    Confirm that your customer intends to pay with current or providedpayment
    method. Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to initiatea
    payment.If the selected payment method requires additional authentication
    steps, thePaymentIntent will transition to the requires_action status
    andsuggest additional actions via next_action. If payment fails,the
    PaymentIntent transitions to the requires_payment_method status or
    thecanceled status if the confirmation limit is reached. Ifpayment succeeds,
    the PaymentIntent will transition to the succeededstatus (or
    requires_capture, if capture_method is set to manual).If the
    confirmation_method is automatic, payment may be attemptedusing our client
    SDKsand the PaymentIntent’s client_secret.After next_actions are handled by
    the client, no additionalconfirmation is required to complete the payment.If
    the confirmation_method is manual, all payment attempts must beinitiated
    using a secret key.If any actions are required for the payment, the
    PaymentIntent willreturn to the requires_confirmation stateafter those
    actions are completed. Your server needs to thenexplicitly re-confirm the
    PaymentIntent to initiate the next paymentattempt. Read the expanded
    documentationto learn more about manual confirmation.
