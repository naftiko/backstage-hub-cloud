    Initiates resumption of a paused subscription, optionally resetting the
    billing cycle anchor and creating prorations. If a resumption invoice is
    generated, it must be paid or marked uncollectible before the subscription
    will be unpaused. If payment succeeds the subscription will become active,
    and if payment fails the subscription will be past_due. The resumption
    invoice will void automatically if not paid by the expiration date.
