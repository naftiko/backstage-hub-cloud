    A webhook endpoint must have a url and a list of enabled_events. You may
    optionally specify the Boolean connect parameter. If set to true, then a
    Connect webhook endpoint that notifies the specified url about events from
    all connected accounts is created; otherwise an account webhook endpoint
    that notifies the specified url only about events from your account is
    created. You can also create webhook endpoints in the webhooks settings
    section of the Dashboard.
