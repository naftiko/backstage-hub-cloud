    Creates a new subscription on an existing customer. Each customer can have
    up to 500 active or scheduled subscriptions.When you create a subscription
    with collection_method=charge_automatically, the first invoice is finalized
    as part of the request.The payment_behavior parameter determines the exact
    behavior of the initial payment.To start subscriptions where the first
    invoice always begins in a draft status, use subscription schedules
    instead.Schedules provide the flexibility to model more complex billing
    configurations that change over time.
