    When you create a new reversal, you must specify a transfer to create it
    on.When reversing transfers, you can optionally reverse part of the
    transfer. You can do so as many times as you wish until the entire transfer
    has been reversed.Once entirely reversed, a transfer can’t be reversed
    again. This method will return an error when called on an already-reversed
    transfer, or when trying to reverse more money than is left on a transfer.
