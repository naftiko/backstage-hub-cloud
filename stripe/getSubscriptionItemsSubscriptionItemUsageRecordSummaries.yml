  description: >-
    For the specified subscription item, returns a list of summary objects. Each
    object in the list provides usage information that’s been summarized from
    multiple usage records and over a subscription billing period (e.g., 15
    usage records in the month of September).The list is sorted in
    reverse-chronological order (newest first). The first list item represents
    the most current usage period that hasn’t ended yet. Since new usage records
    can still be added, the returned summary information for the subscription
    item’s ID should be seen as unstable until the subscription billing period
    ends.
