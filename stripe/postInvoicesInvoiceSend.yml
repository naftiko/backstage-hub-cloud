  description: >-
    Stripe will automatically send invoices to customers according to your
    subscriptions settings. However, if you’d like to manually send an invoice
    to your customer out of the normal schedule, you can do so. When sending
    invoices that have already been paid, there will be no reference to the
    payment in the email.Requests made in test-mode result in no emails being
    sent, despite sending an invoice.sent event.
