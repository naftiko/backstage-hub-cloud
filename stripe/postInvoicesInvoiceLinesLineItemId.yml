    Updates an invoice’s line item. Some fields, such as tax_amounts, only live
    on the invoice line item,so they can only be updated through this endpoint.
    Other fields, such as amount, live on both the invoiceitem and the invoice
    line item, so updates on this endpoint will propagate to the invoice item as
    well.Updating an invoice’s line item is only possible before the invoice is
    finalized.
